Point PlayerZero to an S3 bucket that we can use for our persistent file storage.
This ensures the code and devtools resources we're processing is persisted within your network, often for compliance purposes.
**Note: This feature is only supported on Enterprise Plans.**

This architecture allows PlayerZero to read and write potentially sensitive data through your servers, ensuring that your code remains on your property and is not stored on our systems.
You retain full control over security, access, and disk-level encryption. For the purposes of this guide, we will focus on the AWS cloud setup using the UI.
If you do not use Amazon AWS / S3, we recommend setting up a [Minio server](https://github.com/minio/minio) as a emulated S3 file system hosted on your network.

## S3 Bucket
To minimize latency, we recommend creating your S3 bucket in the us-east-1 region, as our systems are currently located there.
However, your bucket can be located anywhere, and we plan to expand our geographical presence in the future.

### Creating the bucket
Name the bucket according to your own business standards. For this example, we will name it `demo-pz-code-sharing`.
<Steps>
    <Step title="Name the bucket">
        Set it to be a general purpose bucket.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Access Controls">
        ACLs disabled (recommended)
        ![AccessControls](/images/s3/config-2.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Disable bucket versioning">
        If data is deleted, it can be recreated from scratch.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Default encryption">
        Enable default encryption with server-side encryption according to the security policies specified by your organization. In this example, we will use the default.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Disable Object Lock">
        We require that Object Lock be disabled, as enabling it will greatly reduce performance.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Finish creating the bucket">
        Now that we completed creating the bucket, now we need to create an API token to give PlayerZero to read and write.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Create an API Token
<Steps>
    <Step title="Create a new user group">
        Using the IAM console, create a new user group called `playerzero`.
        Add your API user to this group if one already exists, or create a new user as described below.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set Permission Policy">
        For the permission policy, add the AmazonS3FullAccess policy to this group. This will grant PlayerZero full access to your S3 bucket.
        ![Permission Policy](/images/s3/api-1.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a New User">
        Create a new user called `playerzero-api` to easily manage access and restrictions without affecting other users or systems. Do not grant this user access to the Management Console.
        ![New User](/images/s3/api-2.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Associate User Group">
        Associate the `playerzero-api` user with the appropriate user group `playerzero` containing the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create Access Key">
        Edit the newly created `playerzero-api` user and click on the `Create access key` link in the summary box. Create an access key for an application running outside AWS to use.

        ![Access Key](/images/s3/api-4.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Provide a Description">
        Provide an appropriate description, such as PlayerZero Access, and create the access key.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Obtain Access Keys">
        You will be shown a screen with the Access Key and the Secret Access Key. **It is not possible to obtain the secret key after this screen. Copy both keys and share them with PlayerZero securely.**
