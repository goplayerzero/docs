title: "Excluding Files with .pzignore"
description: "Configure your repository to exclude sensitive or unnecessary files from PlayerZero’s analysis."
---

## Introduction

A `.pzignore` file is placed in the root directory of your repository to exclude specific files or folders from PlayerZero’s code ingestion process. This works similarly to a `.gitignore` file, allowing you to specify patterns of files that PlayerZero should ignore.

### Why Use `.pzignore`?

1. **Security**  
   - Prevents secrets or credentials from being analyzed  
   - Excludes configuration files with tokens, keys, or personal data  
   - Protects private encryption keys

2. **Performance**  
   - Skips large binary files and build artifacts  
   - Ignores bulky generated files that add no debugging value

3. **Noise Reduction**  
   - Excludes temporary or backup files  
   - Skips local development files or third-party dependencies  
   - Keeps the code analysis focused on relevant source files

## How to Implement `.pzignore`

1. **Create the file**  
   In your repository’s root directory, create a new file named `.pzignore`.

2. **Add file patterns**  
   Each line in `.pzignore` represents a pattern for files or directories PlayerZero should skip. Patterns can use wildcards (e.g., `*.pem`) or relative paths (e.g., `dist/`).

3. **Commit the file**  
   Commit `.pzignore` to your repository. PlayerZero will automatically detect and honor these patterns on subsequent ingestions.

4. **Maintain regularly**  
   - Review and update `.pzignore` as your repository evolves  
   - Remove unused patterns to keep the file concise  
   - Add new patterns for newly introduced sensitive files or folders

## Example: `.pzignore` File

Below is a sample `.pzignore` file that demonstrates common exclusions. Feel free to customize or expand patterns to meet your specific needs.

```plaintext
# .pzignore

# Security - sensitive files
.env
secrets/
**/config/credentials.yml
private_key.pem
*.pfx
**/auth/tokens.json

# Build and dependencies
node_modules/
dist/
build/
*.min.js
vendor/

# Generated files
*.generated.ts
swagger.json
coverage/
.nyc_output/

# Large data files
*.csv
*.parquet
*.gz
*.zip
data/backups/

# Local development
.idea/
.vscode/
*.local
.DS_Store
```

### Best Practices

- **Start with security**: Immediately exclude any known secret or private key files.  
- **Document your ignores**: Use comments to explain why certain patterns are there.  
- **Review regularly**: Each time you introduce a new technology or store new data in your repo, check if `.pzignore` needs to be updated.  
- **Educate your team**: Make sure everyone on your team understands how `.pzignore` helps safeguard sensitive files and reduce noise in PlayerZero.

By effectively using `.pzignore`, you ensure that PlayerZero focuses on the code and files that truly matter while maintaining both security and performance in your development workflow.
