# Overview

PlayerZero maps out your code‚Äôs interconnections‚Äîacross services, files, and repositories‚Äîto give you a full picture of how your system fits together. This guide will show you how to use PlayerZero to analyze method calls, class references, and shared libraries ‚Äì making it easy to trace the ripple effects of a change, understand service interactions, and explore feature implementations across a distributed codebase.

## Prerequisites

## Process

### 1. Kickoff an AI Chat, Set Context
From the input field on the homepage or via a debug report in DevTools, you can begin a conversation with PlayerZero.

- *Example*: ‚ÄúWhich services rely on the user profile component?‚Äù

### 2. Ask Follow-up Questions
PlayerZero provides targeted explanations and suggestions based on your focus, pulling from both code relationships and session data.

- *Example*: ‚ÄúWhat would break if I modify the user profile component?‚Äù

## Contextual Scenarios
Below are context specific categories to guide your learning about dependencies. 

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Service-to-Service Interactions">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - What services are involved in the [specific feature] flow?  
    - Show the communication between [service A] and [service B]  
    - What APIs does [service] expose and who consumes them?  
    - Which services process messages or events from [another service]?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Repo Dependencies">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - Where is [shared component/class] used across repositories?  
    - Which repositories depend on [utility or library]?  
    - Show all references to [specific function] across services  
    - Where is [interface or abstract class] implemented?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk & Impact Analysis">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - What would break if I changed [shared function or component]?  
    - What downstream services are impacted by [specific change]?  
    - Who depends on [constant, config, or shared state]?  
    - Which systems are tightly coupled with [legacy implementation]?  
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Prompting Tips

1. **Anchor concepts together** ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow does [Service A] interact with [Library B]?‚Äù
2. **Adjust context scope** ‚Äì Zoom in on specific files or pull system-wide dependencies.
3. **Define the output you want** ‚Äì Ask for code snippets, summaries, relationships, or histories.
4. **Follow the thread** ‚Äì Use follow-ups like ‚ÄúWhere else is this service used?‚Äù
