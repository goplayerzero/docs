# Overview

With PlayerZero, teams can quickly generate internal documentation by asking questions about any aspect of their codebase or product functionality, receiving detailed explanations drawn from the entire system. The AI assistant breaks down complex systems into digestible guides and explains code implementations, helping new team members understand both the how and why of system design. This shared knowledge base accelerates onboarding and ensures consistent understanding across the organization, reducing the time senior team members spend explaining common concepts.

## Prerequisites

## Process

### 1. Identify Documentation Needs
Determine which areas need documentation and consider common questions from new team members. Compile a list of key systems or processes to cover‚Äîanything from fundamental architecture overviews to specific feature implementations.

### 2. Kickoff an AI Chat, Set Context
Open PlayerZero‚Äôs AI chat interface and begin by asking foundational questions, as informed by step #1:

> "Can you explain how our authentication system works across our services?"  
> "What are the main components of our data processing pipeline?"

This ensures the AI understands the scope of your system and tailors explanations accordingly.

### 3. Generate Detailed Explanations
Ask the AI to elaborate on system architecture, code implementations, business logic, or common workflows. The AI provides context-aware explanations by drawing from your codebase, ensuring accuracy and relevance to your specific environment.

### 4. Create Onboarding Guides
Target your questions toward new team members who need a high-level overview of your stack:

> "Can you create a guide for new developers about our deployment process?"  
> "Help me create an overview of our main services and how they interact."

These guides accelerate onboarding, so new hires can quickly get up to speed on how everything works.

### 5. Enhance with Examples
Ask for relevant code samples directly from your codebase. The AI can pull specific snippets and show how to implement or modify them, helping to illustrate common use cases or best practices.

### 6. Organize and Share
Share the guides with the appropriate teams. Use PlayerZero‚Äôs collaboration features to collect feedback or allow direct edits. This approach keeps everyone aligned on how the system operates.
