## Goal
PlayerZero is an engineering platform that can help you manage your releases.
Our AI learns the relationship between the code that's being written to its product and customer impact.
This helps answer two simple questions:
1. What are the most important problems I need to fix now?
2. How do I make sure they never happen again?

By the end of this setup, we'll be able to answer both.

## How it works (in short)
PlayerZero's magic is in the data it can bring together to create deep efficiencies for the way we do leveraged tasks like
code reviews and release monitoring. At a high level, here's what we're doing and how we're doing it.

<MyComponent title={'Custom title'} />

<Steps>
    <Step title="Connect your codebase">
        We've built connections into the key platforms modern engineering teams use to build products.
        To start, **PlayerZero integrates into code repositories** using GitHub, Azure, Gitlab, Bitbucket and other git repositories to listen
        for Pull Request (PR) and Merge Request (MR) changes. We model an index of your codebase and how it changes over time.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Connect your customer and operational data">
        Then, we import your product and customer data. Depending on your stack, this might be a combination of one or more platforms.
        We have first party, API integrations into platforms like:
        - **Product Management** (Linear, Jira, Azure DevOps, GitLab, and more)
        - **Customer Ticketing** (Zendesk, Salesforce, Intercom, Jira Service, Front, and *dozens* more)
        - **Analytics** (Amplitude, Mixpanel, and our own custom SDKs)

        This data enables PlayerZero to augment the code change index we built in the previous step with operational and customer data. For example, we can find a relationship that says
        "when you change `X` code, `Y` problem tends to happen, and `Z` number of users complained about it last time".
    </Step>
    <Step title="Send errors and system telemetry data">
        Finally, PlayerZero can also capture system errors and issues to provide even more clarity into the context and scope of issues happening after code releases.
        To capture this data we have our own custom sdks (such as our Web SDK) and integrations into providers like OpenTelemetry, Datadog, and Sentry.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Train the PlayerZero model (and begin!)">
        Give PlayerZero a few hours to import your data and train our models to train an integrated model and then let's get started.
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Setup
Now in more detail.
### Prerequisites
1. A PlayerZero account. You can get started with a free trial account.
2. Sufficient permissions to provide read access to your git repository and ticketing system.

### Connect your codebase

### Connect your product management tool

### Connect an external ticketing tool (if applicable)

### Add the Web SDK (web products only)
If you have a web product, we highly recommend adding in the PlayerZero web sdk. It's a one line javascript snippet
that automatically captures customer context, analytics, and errors on the client side. This helps bootstrap our models quickly and provide complete debugging context
for new issues. [You can find the instructions to implement the web sdk here](/api-reference/web/web-sdk).

If you don't have a web product, you can skip this step!

### Forward server side logs (advanced)
Similar to how the web-sdk can capture client side exceptions and context, PlayerZero also support capturing server side context.
If you're using a product like Datadog or Sentry we can directly integrate into those.
Otherwise, we have our own custom node.js SDK and an integration into Open Telemetry.
