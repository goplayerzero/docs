# Connect Your Codebase

Connecting your code repository is the only step required to activate PlayerZero’s AI-powered debugging and predictive insights.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Repository">
    PlayerZero integrates with popular code repositories such as GitHub, Azure, GitLab, Bitbucket, and more.
    Select the platform you use to host your code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Access">
    Grant PlayerZero read access to your repository. This allows us to monitor pull requests, merge requests, and code changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Monitoring">
    Once connected, our system immediately begins indexing your code changes and correlates them with production issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

1. A PlayerZero account (free trial available).
2. Appropriate permissions to grant read access to your repository (e.g., OAuth or Personal Access Tokens).

## What Happens Next?

After connecting your codebase, you can optionally enhance your setup by integrating:
- **Customer & Operational Data:** Tools like Jira, Zendesk, or Salesforce.
- **Telemetry Data:** Integrations with Datadog, Sentry, or OpenTelemetry.
- **Web SDK:** To capture client-side context and errors.

But remember – **connecting your codebase is all you need to get started.**
