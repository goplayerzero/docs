## Why Connect Your Codebase?

Once your repository is connected, PlayerZero:
- **Indexes your code:** Tracking changes over time.
- **Correlates code changes:** Linking them to production issues.
- **Provides actionable insights:** Empowering your team to fix problems before they escalate.

Other integrations (customer data, telemetry, etc.) are optional enhancements available as you grow with our platform.
