### Don't support your app yet? Sign up for a private beta.

At its core, PlayerZero is a data company that sits in between engineering and
product data. This means that the magic behind PlayerZero can be extended to
include mobile applications, and even purely backend / distributed systems with
essentially the same form factor.

Today, we have general availability support for web applications, and are
working in private beta to support **React Native mobile apps** and an **API
integration to support server-side applications** as well. If you're interested,
join the Slack community above, and sign up to be included in the private beta
