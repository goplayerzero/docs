## Introduction
PlayerZero is AI that helps you manage your releases. We plug into two key workflows.
1. **Code review and testing.** PlayerZero builds a model of how your code correlates to customer impact.
We use this to infer how new code changes might impact customers before a change has ever been made.
2. **Release monitoring and debugging.** Once a release has been deployed, we use AI to help monitor the release and surface the most important problems your team should focus on.
And then we send that to Slack (or Teams) so you can quickly debug and find a resolution.
