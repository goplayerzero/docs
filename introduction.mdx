## Introduction
PlayerZero trains models that learn the customer impact of developer output. We apply these models in practice to accelerate quality and velocity, focusing on two core development and support workflows:
1. **Debug any customer issue to its underlying context and line of code.**
2. **Predict how specific code changes might cause customer problems.**
