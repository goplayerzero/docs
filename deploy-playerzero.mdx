    </Step>
</Steps>


## **Create or Join a Project**

### **If you're creating a project for the first time**

1. [Create an account](https://go.playerzero.app)
2. Name and create a workspace

- If you want other teammembers with the same email domain to be able to automatically join, check the "Allow anyone with @domain emails to join this project." box.

### **If you're joining an existing project**

1. [Create an account](https://go.playerzero.app)
2. If sharing has been setup correctly for the desired project, the name of the project will appear.
- If you do not see the "Join an existing project" option, but rather just the "Create a new project" option, then contact your project admin and ask them to either invite you directly or enable domain sharing.


### **If you want to create/join an additional project**

At the top-left of the PlayerZero portal, select the option to create/join a new project. If you don't see the project you're looking for listed, contact your project admin and ask them to either invite you directly or enable domain sharing.



## Connect Your Code

The primary step is to grant PlayerZero access to your [source control management](/connector/code/github) (SCM) system. You may have already connected an SCM system during the signup process. If so, you can proceed to enabling specific repositories below.

To connect a repository:

1. Find the appropriate SCM connector on the homepage, or navigate to the [SCM connector list page](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/repos) in settings
2. Select Your SCM System

## Enable Specific Repositories

After connecting your SCM, you need to select which repositories PlayerZero should monitor. In the settings page, toggle the repositories you want to enable for ingestion.

- On the [SCM connector list page](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/repos), toggle on repositories that should be ingested. 
- Here you can also toggle the primary reference branch (Main/Master)

## Allow for Ingestion

Once you’ve enabled your repositories, PlayerZero will begin analyzing the code to surface relevant insights. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size and complexity of your repositories.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! Now that you’re up and running, here are the next steps to get the most out of PlayerZero:

- [**Invite Your Team**](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/team) – Add team members to collaborate on issue tracking and resolution.
- [**Integrate with Project Management**](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/product-management) – Connect PlayerZero to Jira, Azure DevOps, or other tools to sync issues with your workflow.
- [**Connect Customer Ticketing**](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/support-tickets) – Link PlayerZero with Zendesk and other customer support platforms to correlate issues with user reports.
- [**Instrument the WebSDK**](/api-reference/web/web-sdk) – Enable user session tracking by integrating PlayerZero’s frontend WebSDK.
- [**Set Up OpenTelemetry**](/api-reference/open-telemetry/setup) – Implement distributed tracing by connecting PlayerZero with OpenTelemetry.
