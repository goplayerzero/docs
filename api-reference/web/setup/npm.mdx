PlayerZero's browser SDK lets you manage PlayerZero on your site, identify your
users, as well as generate links to devtools and send your own custom events.

The SDK itself is published as an `npm` package and hosted on
[Github](https://github.com/goplayerzero/sdk-web) with an MIT license.

Let's get started!

### Install the SDK

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm i @goplayerzero/sdk-web --save
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn add @goplayerzero/sdk-web
    ```

</CodeGroup>

### Initialize the SDK

Call the `PlayerZero.init(<PROJECT_ID>)` function with your Project ID as soon
as you can in your website startup process. You can find your projectId in the
[Setting > Data Collection](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/data) section in
your project.

<Warning>
    Calling init a second time after successful initialization will trigger
    console warnings. If you need to programmatically check if PlayerZero has been
    initialized at some point in your code, you can call
    `PlayerZero.isInitialized()`.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

    ```jsx React
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import "./index.css";
    import App from "./App";
    import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";

    PlayerZero.init("your project id here");

    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
    ```

    ```jsx Angular
    import { Component } from "@angular/core";
    import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";
    import { environment } from "../environments/environment";

    @Component({
        selector: "app-root",
        templateUrl: "app.component.html",
        styleUrls: ["./app.component.scss"],
    })
    export class AppComponent {
        constructor() {
        PlayerZero.init("<your project id here>");
    }
    }
    ```

    ```jsx Vue
    import Vue from "vue";
    import App from "./App.vue";
    import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";

    PlayerZero.init("your project id here");
        Vue.prototype.$PlayerZero = PlayerZero;

        new Vue({
            render: (h) => h(App),
        }).$mount("#app");
    ```

    ```jsx Vue 3
    import { createApp } from "vue";
    import App from "./App.vue";
    import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";

    PlayerZero.init("your project id here");

        const app = createApp(App);
        app.config.globalProperties.$PlayerZero = PlayerZero;
        app.mount("#app");
        ```

        ```jsx JavaScript/Other
        import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";

        // put this somewhere in your main file, and make sure it only get's called once!
        PlayerZero.init("your project id here");
    ```
</CodeGroup>

### Setup user Identity

Once PlayerZero is initialized, you can make calls to the PlayerZero SDK. The
best next step is to set up user identity. This snippet is best placed in your
codebase wherever you establish identity or know who the user is. For many, this
means its can be placed as a side effect of your authorization logic.

```jsx
PlayerZero.identify("userId", {
name: "Billy Joel",
    email: "[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
    group: "Pied Piper",
});
```

### Configure your domains

You can control how we collect data and turn on and off specific features based
on your preferences via the dashboard. Take a look at the
[Web Configuration](/docs/domain-controls) page for more. Most teams don't have
to change these, but they're always there for you.

You should be all set up & ready to go! Explore the PlayerZero API below.

### Advanced Usage

Once PlayerZero is initialized, you can make calls to the PlayerZero SDK. These
are optional, but you may find yourself needing them one day.

#### Track custom analytics events

```jsx
PlayerZero.track("checkout", { item: "chocolate" });
```

#### Generate a Devtools URL

```jsx
PlayerZero.devtoolsUrl().then((url) =>
console.log("PlayerZero Devtools URL", url)
);
```

#### PlayerZero API

- `PlayerZero.init(projectId: string)` \- Initialize PlayerZero on your site
with the specific Project ID. The project id can be found on the
[Settings > Data Collection page](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/data)
- `PlayerZero.isInitialized(): Boolean` \- Check if PlayerZero is initialized in
your application.
- `PlayerZero.identify(userId: string, metadata: Record<string, unknown>)` \-
Identify your user with PlayerZero
- `PlayerZero.setUserVars(metadata: Record<string, unknown>)` \- Set user
properties & metadata without resetting the identity`
- `PlayerZero.track(event: string, metadata?: Record<string, unknown>)` \- Send
an analytics event to PlayerZero
- `PlayerZero.prompt()` \- Prompt the user to upload their Devtools Report`
- `PlayerZero.devtoolsUrl(): Promise<string>` \- Generate a Devtools URL for the
