---

The script tag is probably the simplest and most universal way to enable
PlayerZero.

In order to do this you will need to make sure you have:

- Made an account in PlayerZero
- Created your first project
- Navigated to the
[Settings > Setup Data Collection](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/data)
page

### Embed the Script Tag

Each project in PlayerZero represents a unique application, not environment.
Therefore most teams that use PlayerZero only have one project. Each project has
a unique project Id and therefore its own unique script tag to properly separate
the data the we collect from that tag and manage the configuration. You can find
your project's `script` tag on the
[Settings > Setup Data Collection](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/data) page.
It should look a little something like this.

Include it as one of the first elements in the `<head>` tag of your `index.html`
file.

```jsx
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://go.playerzero.app/record/<your project id>"
  async
  crossorigin
></script>
```

### Setup User Identity

Once the script is loaded, we expose the `playerzero` object on the `window`
with a few utility functions to help you identify and manage different actions
around the PlayerZero script's lifecycle.

The most important and useful thing to do with this is to use
`playerzero.identify()` to distinguish and describe your users as well as
introduce your own custom per-user properties. It really adds a final touch of
context & polish to the data we collect.

You can set this up with the snippet below wherever you can resolve your app's
user identity:

```jsx
// This is an example script - don't forget to change it!
playerzero.identify("<USER_ID>", {
  name: "<DISPLAY_NAME>",
  email: "<USER_EMAIL>",
  group: "<CUSTOMER_ID_OR_OTHER_GROUP>",
});
```

### Configure your domains

You can control how we collect data and turn on and off specific features based
on your preferences via the dashboard. Take a look at the
[Web Configuration](/docs/domain-controls) page for more. Most teams don't have
to change these, but they're always there for you.

### FAQ

#### `ReferenceError: playerzero is not defined` when you're calling `identify`

By default, the async tag on the `<script>` above asynchronously loads the
script in the background without affecting the load performance of the page.
Because of this, there is a chance that your application codebase get's to
calling `playerzero.identify()` before the script has had a chance to load.
There are a few ways to work around this.

1. If you're really trying to do this in a Javascript application such a React
or Angular product, we'd recommend looking at the [Web SDK](/setup/web-sdk) so
that the identify call automatically waits for playerzero to be loaded before
and handles the complexity gracefully.
2. If you're populating the identity from the server side or need to instrument
identity directly in the HTML and cannot use the [Web SDK](/setup/web-sdk)
there's still an option for you! The playerzero script emits a
`playerzero_ready` event the moment it's loaded, and if the `playerzero`
object is not yet available in the window, you can wait for the event before
calling the identity. This could look a little something like this.

```jsx
const userId = "userId";
const metadata = {
  name: "<DISPLAY_NAME>",
  email: "<USER_EMAIL>",
  group: "<CUSTOMER_ID_OR_OTHER_GROUP>",
};

if (window.playerzero) {
  // PlayerZero has loaded
  window.playerzero.identify(userId, metadata);
} else {
  // PlayerZero has not loaded, so we'll wait for the ready event
  window.addEventListener(
    "playerzero_ready",
    () => {
      window.playerzero.identify(userId, metadata);
    },
    { once: true }
  );
}
```
