There are 3 unique ways to get PlayerZero set up on your web application. Choose the one you're most comfortable with.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="npm package">
        PlayerZero's browser SDK lets you manage PlayerZero on your site, identify your
        users, as well as generate links to devtools and send your own custom events.

        The SDK itself is published as an `npm` package and hosted on
        [Github](https://github.com/goplayerzero/sdk-web) with an MIT license.

        Let's get started!

        ### Install the SDK

        <CodeGroup>

            ```bash npm
            npm i @goplayerzero/sdk-web --save
            ```

            ```bash yarn
            yarn add @goplayerzero/sdk-web
            ```

        </CodeGroup>

        ### Initialize the SDK

        Call the `PlayerZero.init(<PROJECT_ID>)` function with your Project ID as soon
        as you can in your website startup process. You can find your projectId in the
        [Setting > Data Collection](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/data) section in
        your project.

        <Warning>
            Calling init a second time after successful initialization will trigger
            console warnings. If you need to programmatically check if PlayerZero has been
            initialized at some point in your code, you can call
            `PlayerZero.isInitialized()`.
        </Warning>

        <CodeGroup>

            ```jsx React
            import React from "react";
            import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
            import "./index.css";
            import App from "./App";
            import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";

            PlayerZero.init("<your project id here>");

            ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
            ```

            ```jsx Angular
            import { Component } from "@angular/core";
            import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";
            import { environment } from "../environments/environment";

            @Component({
                selector: "app-root",
                templateUrl: "app.component.html",
                styleUrls: ["./app.component.scss"],
            })
            export class AppComponent {
                constructor() {
                PlayerZero.init("<your project id here>");
            }
            }
            ```

            ```jsx Vue
            import Vue from "vue";
            import App from "./App.vue";
            import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";

            PlayerZero.init("<your project id here>");
                Vue.prototype.$PlayerZero = PlayerZero;

                new Vue({
                    render: (h) => h(App),
                }).$mount("#app");
                ```

                ```jsx Vue 3
                import { createApp } from "vue";
                import App from "./App.vue";
                import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";

                PlayerZero.init("<your project id here>");

                    const app = createApp(App);
                    app.config.globalProperties.$PlayerZero = PlayerZero;
                    app.mount("#app");
                    ```

                    ```jsx JavaScript/Other
                    import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";

                    // put this somewhere in your main file, and make sure it only get's called once!
                    PlayerZero.init("<your project id here>");
                        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        ### Setup user Identity

        Once PlayerZero is initialized, you can make calls to the PlayerZero SDK. The
        best next step is to set up user identity. This snippet is best placed in your
        codebase wherever you establish identity or know who the user is. For many, this
        means its can be placed as a side effect of your authorization logic.

        ```jsx
        PlayerZero.identify("userId", {
            name: "Billy Joel",
            email: "[[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
            group: "Pied Piper",
        });
        ```

        ### Configure your domains

        You can control how we collect data and turn on and off specific features based
        on your preferences via the dashboard. Take a look at the
        [Web Configuration](/docs/domain-controls) page for more. Most teams don't have
        to change these, but they're always there for you.

        You should be all set up & ready to go! Explore the PlayerZero API below.

        ### Advanced Usage

        Once PlayerZero is initialized, you can make calls to the PlayerZero SDK. These
        are optional, but you may find yourself needing them one day.

        #### Track custom analytics events

        ```jsx
        PlayerZero.track("checkout", { item: "chocolate" });
        ```

        #### Generate a Devtools URL

        ```jsx
        PlayerZero.devtoolsUrl().then((url) =>
        console.log("PlayerZero Devtools URL", url)
        );
        ```

        #### PlayerZero API

        - `PlayerZero.init(projectId: string)` \- Initialize PlayerZero on your site
        with the specific Project ID. The project id can be found on the
        [Settings > Data Collection page](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/data)
        - `PlayerZero.isInitialized(): Boolean` \- Check if PlayerZero is initialized in
        your application.
        - `PlayerZero.identify(userId: string, metadata: Record<string, unknown>)` \-
        Identify your user with PlayerZero
        - `PlayerZero.setUserVars(metadata: Record<string, unknown>)` \- Set user
        properties & metadata without resetting the identity`
        - `PlayerZero.track(event: string, metadata?: Record<string, unknown>)` \- Send
        an analytics event to PlayerZero
        - `PlayerZero.prompt()` \- Prompt the user to upload their Devtools Report`
        - `PlayerZero.devtoolsUrl(): Promise<string>` \- Generate a Devtools URL for the
            current session
            - `PlayerZero.kill()` \- Shut down PlayerZero immediately. PlayerZero cannot be
            reinitialized after this is called.

    <Tab title="<script/> tag">
        The script tag is probably the simplest and most universal way to enable
        PlayerZero.

        In order to do this you will need to make sure you have:

        - Made an account in PlayerZero
        - Created your first project
        - Navigated to the
        [Settings > Setup Data Collection](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/data)
        page

        ### Embed the Script Tag

        Each project in PlayerZero represents a unique application, not environment.
        Therefore most teams that use PlayerZero only have one project. Each project has
        a unique project Id and therefore its own unique script tag to properly separate
        the data the we collect from that tag and manage the configuration. You can find
        your project's `script` tag on the
        [Settings > Setup Data Collection](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/data) page.
        It should look a little something like this.

        Include it as one of the first elements in the `<head>` tag of your `index.html`
        file.

        ```jsx
        <script
            type="text/javascript"
            src="https://go.playerzero.app/record/<your project id>"
            async
            crossorigin
        ></script>
        ```

        ### Setup User Identity

        Once the script is loaded, we expose the `playerzero` object on the `window`
        with a few utility functions to help you identify and manage different actions
        around the PlayerZero script's lifecycle.

        The most important and useful thing to do with this is to use
        `playerzero.identify()` to distinguish and describe your users as well as
        introduce your own custom per-user properties. It really adds a final touch of
        context & polish to the data we collect.

        You can set this up with the snippet below wherever you can resolve your app's
        user identity:

        ```jsx
        // This is an example script - don't forget to change it!
        playerzero.identify("<USER_ID>", {
            name: "<DISPLAY_NAME>",
            email: "<USER_EMAIL>",
            group: "<CUSTOMER_ID_OR_OTHER_GROUP>",
        });
            ```

            ### Configure your domains

            You can control how we collect data and turn on and off specific features based
            on your preferences via the dashboard. Take a look at the
            [Web Configuration](/docs/domain-controls) page for more. Most teams don't have
            to change these, but they're always there for you.

            ### FAQ

            #### `ReferenceError: playerzero is not defined` when you're calling `identify`

            By default, the async tag on the `<script>` above asynchronously loads the
                script in the background without affecting the load performance of the page.
                Because of this, there is a chance that your application codebase get's to
                calling `playerzero.identify()` before the script has had a chance to load.
                There are a few ways to work around this.

                1. If you're really trying to do this in a Javascript application such a React
                or Angular product, we'd recommend looking at the [Web SDK](/setup/web-sdk) so
                that the identify call automatically waits for playerzero to be loaded before
                and handles the complexity gracefully.
                2. If you're populating the identity from the server side or need to instrument
                identity directly in the HTML and cannot use the [Web SDK](/setup/web-sdk)
                there's still an option for you! The playerzero script emits a
                `playerzero_ready` event the moment it's loaded, and if the `playerzero`
                object is not yet available in the window, you can wait for the event before
                calling the identity. This could look a little something like this.

                ```jsx
                const userId = "userId";
                const metadata = {
                    name: "<DISPLAY_NAME>",
                    email: "<USER_EMAIL>",
                    group: "<CUSTOMER_ID_OR_OTHER_GROUP>",
                };

                if (window.playerzero) {
                    // PlayerZero has loaded
                    window.playerzero.identify(userId, metadata);
                } else {
                    // PlayerZero has not loaded, so we'll wait for the ready event
                    window.addEventListener(
                        "playerzero_ready",
                        () => {
                            window.playerzero.identify(userId, metadata);
                        },
                        { once: true }
                    );
                }
                ```

        ### Configure your domains

        You can control how we collect data and turn on and off specific features based
        on your preferences via the dashboard. Take a look at the
        [Web Configuration](/docs/domain-controls) page for more. Most teams don't have
        to change these, but they're always there for you.

        ### What's happening under the hood

        Under the hood, when you enable the PlayerZero Web destination we're setting up
        3 things for you automatically:

        1. Segment will inject the snippet automatically into your client frontend. The
        snippet will automatically instrument a basic set of analytics events such as
        button clicks and page loads, and will also start capturing JS and API issues
        happening in the browser.
        2. Segment will also forward any `track()` calls that you make to
        `analytics.js`( the Segment library) to PlayerZero. This will enable you to
        understand the impact of your issues relative to the higher order events you
        may have instrumented, automatically.
        3. Segment will forward any `identify()` calls so that users that are identified
        in Segment will also be identified in PlayerZero.
