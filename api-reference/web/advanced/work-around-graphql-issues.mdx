<Warning>
Only for Apollo GraphQL
 
This only has to be done if you are building on Apollo's GraphQL library. Otherwise, you can safely ignore this page.

</Warning>

PlayerZero wraps `window.fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` calls during the regular
course of it monitoring in order to capture performance & network errors and
build better devtools. Out of the box we also detect and separate different
graphql calls based on the `operationName` parameter.

If you use an [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com) server to host
your GraphQL endpoint, you need to do one additional step to enable PlayerZero
completely.

Embed this snippet in addition to your regular [setup](/docs/getting-started) as
the first tag in your `<head/>` of the `index.html` file. This helps PlayerZero
get access to the fetch object first before the page loads.

```html
<script>
  const originalFetch = window.fetch;
  if (!window["playerzero"]) window["playerzero"] = {};

  window["playerzero"]["monkey_patch_ts"] = performance.now();
  window.fetch = function (url, options) {
    // preserve arity
    if (
      window["playerzero"] &&
      window["playerzero"]["before_fetch_apply"] &&
      window["playerzero"]["after_fetch_apply"]
    ) {
      const beforeFetchApplyResult = window["playerzero"]["before_fetch_apply"](
        url,
        options
      );
      const args = arguments;
      return new Promise((resolve) => {
        originalFetch.apply(this, args).then((response) => {
          return window["playerzero"]
            ["after_fetch_apply"](response, beforeFetchApplyResult)
            .finally(() => resolve(response));
        });
      });
    } else return originalFetch.apply(this, arguments);
  };
</script>
```
