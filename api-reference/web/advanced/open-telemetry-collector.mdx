title: "Send Open Telemetry to multiple locations"
---

<Warning>
This is only necessary if a team wants to send Open Telemetry data to multiple places,
  such as a cloud provider or logging service and PlayerZero
</Warning>

PlayerZero uses Open Telemetry, an open standard for telemetry data, to collect data
about your users and issues.  Sometimes teams have other tools that also use Open
Telemetry data, such as Graphana.  But Open Telemetry only sends data to a single place.

To solve this problem, users can run an Open Telemetry Collector, which can be configured
to send data to multiple places, using multiple protocols.

Instructions to run the Open Telemetry Collector are [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).

Here is an example Open Telemetry config.yaml, that it set up to receive messages in http protobuf format, then send
to PlayerZero, plus GCP
```yaml
receivers:
  otlp/rdev:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  otlp/rprod:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4319

processors:
# These are optional, but recommended
  batch:
    # batch metrics before sending to reduce API usage
    send_batch_max_size: 200
    send_batch_size: 200
    timeout: 5s
  memory_limiter:
    # drop metrics if memory usage gets too high
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_percentage: 65
    spike_limit_percentage: 20
# Example of GCP
  resourcedetection:
    detectors: [gcp]
    timeout: 10s

exporters:
  otlphttp/dev:
    endpoint: https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer <Your API token here>"
      X-PzProd: "false"
    encoding: proto

  otlphttp/prod:
    endpoint: https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer <Your API token here>"
      X-PzProd: "true"
    encoding: proto

# Example of gcp, more is likely needed
