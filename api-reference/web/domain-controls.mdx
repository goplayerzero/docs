  "PlayerZero is configured at the domain level allowing you to control what is and isn't captured."

### Where is this?

You can explore these controls on the
[Settings > Web SDK](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/web) page of your
project. You'll see a page that looks like this:

### Domain Level Controls

Each added domain has four toggles and a Dataset field.

1. **Enabled** \- If this is off, the recorder will be completely disabled for
   that particular domain.
2. **Production** \- This toggle labels events with a production flag.
3. **Show 'Share Devtools' Button** \- By default this is on for localhost to
   enable easy sharing and off everywhere else. If you want to have a button
   built into your own site to prompt a share, you can use the Javascript API
   `playerzero.prompt()` call. `Ctrl + K` works everywhere however.
4. **Enable OpenTelemetry Integration** \- If monitoring is off, it means that we won't capture any errors or product analytics events from that domain. By default we have this on everywhere except localhost, since local development on `localhost` tends to generate a lot of unnecessary noise. We recommend having monitoring on for your production and staging environments, and off everywhere else.
5. **Dataset** \- This field sets the Dataset value that's captured with events in the browser.

You can also **add a domain** as well to configure these five properties in your
own way. (Glob patterns are supported to wildcard match subdomains)

<Warning>
  Adding a domain - a few quirks to keep your eye out for * When adding a
  domain, make sure to include the `www.` prepending your domain if your domain
  truly starts with that. Often times browsers hide the `www.` portion. If it's
  a different subdomain, you have nothing to worry about! * Rules are pulled
  from the first matching domain. So if you have `_.amazon.com` as the first
  domain and then `www.amazon.com` as the second, the rules of `_.amazon.com`
  will take precedence because it is first.
</Warning>

#### Example Domain Setup

At PlayerZero here's how we've set up our environments.

![](/images/web-sdk-domain-configuration-pz.png)

**Here's why:**

1. **Domain 1: `localhost`** On localhost we want to be able to share devtools,
   but we don't want to have monitoring on.
2. **Domain 2: `go.playerzero.app`** This is our production, and we definitely
   want to capture all issues and therefore have monitoring on. However we don't
   want a blue button on every page and therefore built it into our support page
   using the API.
3. **Domain 3: `*.playerzero.app`** Our QA and staging environments are
   subdomains of `*.playerzero.app`. Therefore when we're testing our code we
   want easy shareability of devtools with the button, and monitoring since our
   QA environments are relatively stable.
4. **Domain 4: `All other domains`** Well, we don't have any deployments outside
   of our main domain, so we don't want to capture any data from outside of our
   domains.

### Network Performance Threshold

PlayerZero will track moments where an API response takes > 8000 ms to resolve
from the clients perspective. If you want to tweak this threshold based on your
goals, feel free to tweak it to what's most meaningful to you.

### Special API Error Phrases

Sometimes systems return 200 status codes, but are actually failing. This is
rare. If you have any special phrases to look out for in the response bodies,
let us know by creating a Special API Error Phrase. If we ever see it, we'll
start building a story around it for you.

### Key Filtering (Beta)

By default we capture API requests and responses, and use a series of industry
standard regexes and filtering to remove most of the basic PII & PCI information
we can find. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Emails
- SSN
- Telephone numbers
- Addresses
- Names
- Credit card numbers
- Authorization
- And many, many more filters.

But it's always possible for us to miss something. If there's a particular JSON
key you don't want us to capture, you can tell us here and we'll redact it on
the browser side before it ever hits our server.
