## Overview
The PlayerZero exporter is an otlphttp exporter for logs with a fatal or error status. You can configure it through environment/system variables, a config file, or however else you have setup your OpenTelemetry agent.
If you have not yet set up OpenTelemetry check out the [open telemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/getting-started/dev/) or see if one of our other connectors makes more sense.

## Configuration
```text
Endpoint = "https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp"
Headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <your-playerzero-api-token>"}
```

### Config File Example
Copy the following into your OpenTelemetry `config.yml` file:
```yaml
exporters:
  otlphttp/playerzero:
    endpoint: "https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer <your-playerzero-api-token>"
```

This should enable forwarding errors to PlayerZero automatically.
