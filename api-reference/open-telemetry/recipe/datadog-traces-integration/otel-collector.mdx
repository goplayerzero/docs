# Using an Open Telemetry Collector

This recipe covers the setup of an Open Telemetry Collector that leverages the experimental Datadog receiver. The collector converts Datadog telemetry to OTLP format and forwards it to PlayerZero.

*Placeholder for collector configuration YAML, Docker run commands, and validation steps.*

## Steps

1. Create a collector configuration file that includes the Datadog receiver.
2. Deploy the collector (e.g., via Docker).
3. Verify that traces are converted and ingested by PlayerZero.
