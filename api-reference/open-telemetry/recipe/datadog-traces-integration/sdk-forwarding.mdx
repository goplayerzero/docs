# Application-Local SDK Forwarding

This recipe demonstrates how to modify your Node.js application so that it sends trace data directly to PlayerZero by using a tracing SDK.

*Placeholder for code examples, SDK initialization instructions, and configuration tips.*

## Steps

1. Initialize the tracer as the very first step in your application.
2. Configure the tracer to forward telemetry to PlayerZero.
3. Validate that traces appear in PlayerZero.
