**PlayerZero brings product analytics to the forefront of how your team
understands, prioritizes, and fixes issues in your web application.**

PlayerZero offers two main workflow solutions depending on your needs: Active
issue monitoring and shareable devtools. To better understand the value of these
experiences, let's highlight some of the assets you can utilize to better
understand what's happening in your application.

## Product Features

### Trending Issues

**Impact-based prioritization**

PlayerZero has the ability to tell you exactly what issues are happening in your
application and the impact they have on the end user experience. How does
PlayerZero measure impact? PlayerZero learns baseline usage patterns and
leverages them to identify 'significant' behavior changes when an error is
introduced in your application.

**Issue overview**

This high level picture of the problem can then be distilled down into
individual session reports (see above), giving your team all the information
they need to debug the issue.

### Shareable Devtools

**Full session overview:**  
PlayerZero gives you all the context you need when a user reports an issue
(cursor movements, API mocks, etc.) so you can debug fast and build faster. Take
it one step further and share a replay with your team, communicate in context,
and validate fixes.

**Devtools, screenshots and more:**  
Want to see what happened behind the curtain and source anomalies? PlayerZero
logs and presents you with session and local storage, dom snapshots, network
calls and console logs.

## Key Workflows

### Active Issue Monitoring

Users are in your application everyday and are often running into issues that
would be hugely valuable to learn more about. You might be asking yourself
questions like:

- What issues are users running into?
- How important are these issues?
- What is result of these issues existing in my application?

With manual session report uploading, the data necessary to paint this picture
does not exist - one off. But with PlayerZero's automatic session uploading, you
have everything you need

When a user runs into a programmatic issue, the user's session report will be
automatically uploaded to PlayerZero.

#### See what's trending

PlayerZero gives you a look into what's happening in your application, broken
down by the impact, areas of your application most affected.

#### Save "views"

We all care about interactions in the application on different levels... You can
create filtered views that show you what matters most to your day-to-day.

#### Setup notifications

If an error falls within the filters of a particular view, and you are
subscribed to that specific view, then you can setup notifications to stay
involved.

**Are you an engineer working on a specific area of the site?** Create a view
for that area and setup slack notification to bump you if something pops up!

**Are you a customer success lead working closely with a big client?** Create a
view for that client and know about the issue before they do! Our user's call
this "delivering a white glove service"

PlayerZero is built to connect your entire team to quality like never before.

### Manual Devtools Upload

PlayerZero gives you a direct line of technical communication to every user in
your application. Take for example, a user is running into an issue that is
blocking them from completing a task – you can now easily ask them to trigger an
upload. By doing this, PlayerZero will package their user session into a
shareable, interactive reports so your engineering team can efficiently
communicate about and debug the issue.

By default, the user session data will be stored locally on the user's browser
until they trigger the upload. At which point, they can send you the information
that you need to solve the problem at hand.

#### Options for triggering a session upload

In order to enable direct uploading, we have built a set of intuitive upload
triggers, depending on the workflow that works best for your team!

- **PlayerZero widget:** This widget is completely optional, but extremely
  functional. It can live at the bottom of your page in case any user or
  internal team member runs across an issue.
- **Key command shortcut:** On a call with a user and want them to send up their
  session in a nice tidy report? Or maybe you don’t want the distraction of the
  widget living on your site? Just ask them to hit Command-K(Mac) or Ctrl+K(PC)!
- **Javascript API:** We’ve given you the flexibility to capture these sessions
  from users in a way that best fits your existing workflow.
- **Integrations:** Support is your first line of defense, and for those
  companies that use Intercom, we’ve made it that much easier to ask your users
  for an PlayerZero issue report!

#### Retrieving the user's session

The team can then jump into the upload report to learn more about the issue in
question a unique. There are two unique ways to grab this specific session:

- Copy and send the link directly from the upload experience
- Go into the PlayerZero app and find it under "All Uploads".

#### Linking upload to trending issue

If Trending Issues is setup for your team in PlayerZero, manually uploaded
sessions becomes that much more valuable!

Note: If you have Trending Issues setup, the other option for better
direct-to-user communication is that they can ping you and you can search
through trending issues to identify the issue.
