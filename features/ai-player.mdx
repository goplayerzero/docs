## What Is an AI Player?

PlayerZero‚Äôs **AI Players** acts as your **knowledge-rich agents**, designed to help you understand, investigate, and solve problems across your codebase and systems. Whether you‚Äôre debugging a tricky issue, exploring architecture, or researching historical changes, the AI Player provides fast, context-aware insights.

To use it, navigate to any project in PlayerZero and start a conversation through the free‚Äëform prompt interface.

## Starting Points

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Free‚ÄëForm Input">
- **Access Point:** Available on the homepage and within any project view.  
- **Use Case:** Ideal for open-ended questions, quick lookups, or initiating deep investigations.  
- **Behavior:** AI builds context from your selected project and branch, then continues to expand the conversation as you refine your queries.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Debug Report">
- **Access Point:** From any session replay or Debug Report timeline.  
- **Use Case:** Perfect when you need to investigate user-reported issues with full session, DOM, and trace context.  
- **Behavior:** Clicking ‚ÄúFind in My Code‚Äù or ‚ÄúDebug‚Äù launches a chat that‚Äôs pre-loaded with session data, related logs, and linked code paths for faster root-cause analysis.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Log Error">
- **Access Point:** From any error log, stack trace, or telemetry panel.  
- **Use Case:** For digging into specific errors or performance alerts without starting a fresh session view.  
- **Behavior:** AI automatically correlates the log or stack trace with relevant files, recent commits, and known historical issues, so you can jump straight to a potential fix.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PR Summary">
- **Access Point:** Directly from Pull Request pages in PlayerZero.  
- **Use Case:** Quickly understand what a PR changes, potential risks, and how it may impact customers.  
- **Behavior:** AI generates a natural-language summary, identifies impacted areas, and lets you ask follow-up questions about specific functions, modules, or risks.  
</Accordion>

## Modes of Operation

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Fast Mode">
- **Purpose:** Instant responses for straightforward questions.  
- **Best For:** Simple code lookups, lightweight explanations, or quick verifications.  
- **Ideal When:** You need an answer *now* and don‚Äôt need detailed reasoning.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Normal Mode">
- **Purpose:** Balanced speed and detail, with transparent reasoning.  
- **Best For:** Most investigation and debugging work.  
- **Special Feature:** Toggle **‚ÄúView Thought Process‚Äù** to see how the AI connects files, context, and logic.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DeepThink / Deep Research Mode">
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive exploration of your codebase and systems.  
- **Best For:** Complex investigations (e.g., *‚ÄúHow does authentication work across all services?‚Äù*).  
- **Behavior:** The AI systematically analyzes files, dependencies, and historical changes to produce a detailed, end‚Äëto‚Äëend understanding.
