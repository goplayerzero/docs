## Example: Defect Resolution (Default)

The built-in workflow handles customer issue resolution end to end.

**Why it works:**
- **Triage and RCA auto-approve** — the agent gathers context and investigates autonomously without blocking on human input
- **Fix requires approval** — a human reviews the proposed code changes before they're applied
- **Test requires approval** — QA sign-off ensures the fix is validated before closing
- **Document & Close requires approval** — ensures proper documentation before the issue is marked resolved

**Key design choice:** The agent can suggest an approver based on who last modified the affected code. This means the right person gets notified at the right time without manual routing.

## Example: Fully Autonomous Pipeline

Set `auto-approve` on every stage to create a pipeline where the agent progresses through the entire workflow without human intervention.

**When to use:**
- Low-severity issues where human gates aren't required
- Internal automation tasks
- High-confidence, well-scoped work

**When to avoid:**
- Production code changes
- Customer-facing fixes
- Any workflow where mistakes are costly

---

## Example: Approval-Heavy Compliance Flow

Gate every stage with manual approval and assign specific individuals as approvers.

**When to use:**
- Regulated environments requiring audit trails
- Workflows where multiple stakeholders must sign off
- High-stakes changes requiring explicit human review at every step

**Configuration:**
- Set `auto-approve` to off on all stages
- Use **Individuals** approver config on each stage with the relevant reviewers
- Use **exit semantics** so approvals read as "I accept the completed work"

## Example: Adding a Custom Stage

Extend the default workflow with a new stage — for example, "Security Review" between Fix and Test.

1. Open the workflow builder
2. Add a new **Work** stage named "Security Review"
3. Write instructions telling the agent to review the fix for security implications, check for input validation, and flag potential vulnerabilities
4. Draw a transition from **Fix** to **Security Review**
5. Draw a transition from **Security Review** to **Test**
6. Remove the direct **Fix → Test** transition
7. Set `auto-approve` to off and configure an approver from your security team

## Best Practices

### Write specific stage instructions

The instruction field is the primary driver of agent behavior. Be explicit about objectives, expected outputs, constraints, and when to escalate.

### Write specific transition conditions

Vague rules like "when ready" lead to premature transitions. Describe what must be true before the agent moves on.

### Use auto-approve for information gathering

Stages focused on assessment, triage, or research work well with auto-approve. Gate transitions where the agent is making or proposing changes.

### Configure approvers by stage

Use **Individuals** when you know who should review (e.g., a QA lead for the Test stage). Use **Player** when the right reviewer depends on context — the agent will suggest someone based on code ownership.

### Use the "Ask a Human" field

Tell the agent when it should stop and ask for help instead of guessing. This is your safety valve for ambiguous situations.

### Export and share workflows

Once a workflow is dialed in, export it and import into other projects. This ensures consistent processes across your organization.

### Monitor the inbox for bottlenecks

If Players pile up in a specific stage, that's a signal to adjust auto-approve settings, add more approvers, or refine stage instructions.
