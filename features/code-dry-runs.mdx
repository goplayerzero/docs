## What Are Code Dry Runs?

Code Dry Runs allow you to describe **test scenarios in natural language** and have AI simulate what would happen before you run actual tests.  This "testing before testing" approach helps you:

- Identify potential issues early  
- Assess risk before execution  
- Validate testing strategies  
- Uncover edge cases through AI-driven analysis  

## Scenario Creation

Build structured scenarios with the following components:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Title & Description">
- Create named scenarios for specific testing situations.  
- Provide a clear description of what you're trying to validate or test.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Initial State">
- Define starting conditions for the test, including:  
  - Required setup or seed data  
  - User permissions and access levels  
  - System configurations needed before testing begins  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Interventions">
- Outline step-by-step actions for the scenario, such as:  
  - User interactions or system events  
  - Optional hints for each step to guide execution  
  - Indicators for what to watch for or measure  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Expected Outcome">
- Define what success looks like:  
  - Specific behaviors or UI states  
  - Data changes or persistence results  
  - Final system state validation  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Source Integration">
- Automatically generate scenarios from:  
  - Existing tickets  
  - Historical issues and known regressions  
  - Relevant user reports tied to your codebase  
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

```
Scenario Title: [Name]

Initial State:
[Describe starting conditions, data, or setup required]

Interventions:
Step 1: [User action] (Hint: [Optional guidance])
Step 2: [System interaction] (Hint: [What to watch for])
Step 3: [Expected behavior]

Expected Outcome:
[Describe the final result, state, or behavior expected]
```

## Simulation and Analysis

Run scenarios through AI-powered simulation ‚Äî no actual code execution required.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="AI-Powered Execution">
- The AI processes each step in your scenario.  
- Predictions are based on:  
  - Your codebase  
  - Historical failure patterns  
  - Known dependencies and system behavior  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Status Tracking">
- Monitor simulations in real time.  
- Scenarios progress through states:  
  - Pending ‚Üí Running ‚Üí Finished or Canceled  
- Includes progress indicators and status logs.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="State Analysis">
- View intermediate states as the AI ‚Äúwalks through‚Äù each intervention.  
- Understand the assumptions, data transitions, and expected results at every stage.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Risk Assessment">
- The AI assigns a likelihood of success:  
  - Unlikely  
  - Uncertain  
  - Very Likely  
- Ratings are based on historical outcomes and risk signals in your code.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prediction vs Reality">
- Compare the AI‚Äôs predicted results with your expected outcomes.  
- Get explanations for any gaps to refine your assumptions.  
- Surface potential edge cases or untested paths before you commit to actual testing.  
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>


## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="UI Testing">
- Simulate user interactions and complex flows.  
- Validate responsive design, navigation, and form submissions without running full UI tests.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Backend Testing">
- Model API calls and service interactions.  
- Analyze data validation, error handling, and integration points.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Database Interactions">
- Predict data persistence, transaction handling, and load behavior.  
- Evaluate integrity checks and potential performance bottlenecks before load testing.  
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>


## Why It Matters

Code Dry Runs transform testing by providing **intelligent pre-analysis**, allowing teams to:

- Refine test scenarios before committing time to execution  
- Identify risks and weak points early  
- Build more comprehensive and resilient test coverage  
- Reduce wasted time on redundant or low-value test cases
