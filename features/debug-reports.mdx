## What Are Debug Reports?

PlayerZero‚Äôs **Debug Reports** provide end-to-end visibility into user sessions, combining user behavior, DOM state, developer tools data, and distributed system traces.  These reports give engineers and support teams **a unified, actionable view** of what happened, why, and where to fix it.
