## Stages

Each stage defines what the agent does during that phase of work.

### Stage Properties

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Short identifier (e.g., "Triage", "RCA", "Fix"). Must be unique within a project. |
| **Instructions** | Detailed prompt for the agent — what to do, what to look for, what outputs to produce. |
| **Type** | **Entry** (starting point), **Work** (intermediate), or **Terminal** (end point). |
| **Auto-approve** | If enabled, transitions out of this stage happen without human approval. |
| **Approver config** | Who can approve: **Player** (agent suggests based on code ownership) or **Individuals** (specific team members). |
| **Archive config** | How completed Players are archived: **Never**, **Manual**, or **Automatic** (after N days). |
| **Ask a human** | Optional guidance on when the agent should stop and escalate to a person. |

### Stage Types

- **Entry**: Work can start here. A workflow can have multiple entry stages.
- **Work**: Intermediate stages where processing happens. Requires incoming and outgoing transitions.
- **Terminal**: Final stage. No outgoing transitions. Work concludes here.

## Transitions

Transitions define the allowed paths between stages.

### Creating a Transition

In the workflow builder, draw a connection from one stage to another. A dialog will prompt you to describe the transition conditions — the rules that tell the agent when to take this path.

### Transition Conditions

Each transition includes an instruction field. Write specific conditions, not vague ones:

- **Good**: "Promote to Fix when root cause has been clearly identified, the issue requires code changes, and failing scenarios demonstrate the bug."
- **Avoid**: "Move to the next stage when ready."

The agent uses these conditions to decide which transition to request.

---

## Approvals

### Auto-approve vs. Manual

- **Auto-approve on**: The agent transitions immediately when it determines the stage work is complete.
- **Auto-approve off** (default): The agent requests the transition and waits for a human to approve.

### Approval Semantics

Two modes are available, configurable at the organization or project level:

- **Entry approval**: "Do you approve the agent entering the next stage?"
- **Exit approval**: "Do you accept the work the agent completed in this stage?"

With exit semantics, both the current and target stage must have auto-approve enabled for automatic transitions.

### Approver Configuration

- **Player**: The agent suggests an approver based on context (e.g., who last modified the affected code). Any project member can approve.
- **Individuals**: Specific team members are designated as approvers for that stage. Only they can approve.

## Archival

### Archive Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Never** | Player is never auto-archived from this stage |
| **Manual** | Users can archive Players manually |
| **Automatic** | Players are archived after a configurable number of days (1, 7, 14, or 30) |

Archived Players move to a special terminal stage and can be **restored** back to their previous stage at any time.

## The Workflow Builder

The visual editor for designing workflows. Access it from **Settings > Stages** in your project.

### Canvas

- **Drag and drop** stage nodes to arrange the layout
- **Draw connections** between stages to create transitions
- **Click a stage** to view or edit its properties in a side panel
- **Click an edge** to view or edit the transition rule

### Sidebar

Lists all stages grouped by type (Entry, Work, Terminal) with buttons to add new stages.

### Validation

The builder displays warning indicators on stages that are missing:
- Incoming connections (no way to reach this stage)
- Outgoing transitions (non-terminal stage with no next steps)

### Toolbar

- **Zoom** in/out and fit view
- **Reorganize** — auto-arrange stages in a hierarchical layout
- **Delete all** — reset the workflow

### Export & Import

Export your workflow as JSON (stages, transitions, agent rules, layout positions). Import into other projects to replicate workflows across your organization.

## The Workflow Inbox

The operational view for managing active work. Access it from **Inbox** in your project.

### Filters

| Filter | Shows |
|---|---|
| **Active** | All non-archived Players |
| **My Issues** | Players where you contributed or need to approve |
| **Engineering** | Players in engineering-focused stages |
| **Archived** | Completed or archived Players (with sub-filters for manual vs. automatic) |

### Time Range

Filter by: All-time, Today, Last 7 days, Last 14 days, or Last 30 days.

### Player Categories

Within a stage, Players are grouped by status:

- **Needs Approval** — Waiting for a human to approve a stage transition
- **Needs Input** — Agent is waiting for information or human guidance
- **In Progress** — Agent is actively working
- **Done** — Stage work is complete

### Inline Review

Click any Player in the inbox to open its full conversation and context in a side panel. Approve transitions, add notes, or redirect — all without leaving the inbox.
