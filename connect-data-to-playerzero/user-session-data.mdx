Capturing user sessions gives your team visibility into the real behavior behind every issue. With PlayerZeroâ€™s Web SDK, you can record interactions like clicks, scrolls, and form inputsâ€”enabling instant replay of user journeys for faster, more confident debugging.

## How It Works

Once the Web SDK is installed on your application:

- PlayerZero records key user interactions and associates them with relevant events (errors, traces, logs).  
- Sessions are tied to deployments, helping teams understand what users were doing when problems occurred.  
- All captured sessions are viewable as replays within PlayerZero, synced with system-level telemetry.

## What This Enables

- **See what users saw**: Reproduce UI bugs and behavioral issues by watching the exact path taken through your product.  
- **Link behavior to errors**: Determine whether user actions, environment, or recent changes triggered the issue.
- **Streamlined root-cause analysis**: Identify the code responsible for customer experience issues.

<Note>PlayerZero captures only whatâ€™s needed to debug issuesâ€”never passwords, PII, or sensitive user input.</Note>
