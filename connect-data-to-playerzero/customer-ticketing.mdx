Integrating your support ticketing system with PlayerZero makes it easier to connect customer-reported issues to the technical context behind them. Whether it's Zendesk, Intercom or another platform, PlayerZero helps your team respond faster and with more clarity.

## How It Works

Once connected:

- PlayerZero links incoming tickets to related errors, logs, and user sessions.  
- Teams can trace tickets back to specific deployments, code changes, and system events.  
- Ticket metadata is displayed alongside technical data for richer debugging and prioritization.

## What This Enables

- **Eliminate context switching**: Go from a ticket to the exact code, logs, or session data in seconds.  
- **See ticket history alongside errors**: Track recurring issues and their impact across customers.

_Tickets are never modifiedâ€”PlayerZero reads metadata only to improve triage and issue resolution._
