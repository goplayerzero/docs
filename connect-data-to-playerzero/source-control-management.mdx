Connecting your source control systemâ€”like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucketâ€”allows PlayerZero to bridge user-facing issues with the exact parts of your code responsible for them. This connection transforms error investigation from manual and reactive into precise, context-rich, and collaborative.

## How It Works  
When you import your codebase into PlayerZero:
- PlayerZero syncs commit metadata, file structures, and diffs over time.  
- All incoming telemetry (errors, traces, session data), internal work-items and customer tickets are cross-referenced against your code history.  
- Changes to the codebaseâ€”new PRs, merges, and deletionsâ€”are indexed continuously so debugging stays accurate and up to date.  

## What This Enables  
- **Trace issues to the source**: Identify the line, file, and commit where a defect originated.  
- **Understand code evolution**: View historical changes, PR discussions, and ownership for any affected file.  
- **Contextual Debugging**: Connect actions and input from other data sources to related code.
