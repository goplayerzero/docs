title: "Backend Telemetry"
---

Integrating backend telemetry lets PlayerZero surface meaningful signals from your servicesâ€”like logs, traces, and errorsâ€”and link them directly to deployments and user impact. This gives your team a deeper, more complete view of how your system behaves in production.

## How It Works

Once your backend is instrumented:

- PlayerZero ingests logs, traces, and error data from your services.  
- Relevant signals are correlated with deployment activity and user sessions.  
- Each error is connected to context from your codebase.
## What This Enables

- **Surface critical issues faster**: Detect anomalies and regressions as they happen across services.  
- **Trace problems across layers**: Follow a request from the frontend into backend systems for full-stack visibility.
- **Streamlined root-cause analysis**: Identify the code responsible for application performance issues.



<Note>PlayerZero integrates with popular observability tools and supports OpenTelemetry out of the box.</Note>
