# Connect Backend Telemetry to PlayerZero

Integrating backend telemetry lets PlayerZero surface meaningful signals from your servicesâ€”like logs, traces, and errorsâ€”and link them directly to deployments and user impact. This gives your team a deeper, more complete view of how your system behaves in production.

## How It Works

Once your backend is instrumented:

- PlayerZero ingests logs, traces, and error data from your services.  
- These signals are correlated with deployment activity and user sessions.  
- Each issue is enriched with context from your codebase, making it easier to identify the root cause.

## What This Enables

- **Surface critical issues faster**: Detect anomalies and regressions as they happen across services.  
- **Trace problems across layers**: Follow a request from the frontend into backend systems for full-stack visibility.

_PlayerZero integrates with popular observability tools and supports OpenTelemetry out of the box._
