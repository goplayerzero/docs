# Link Product Ticketing Tools to PlayerZero

Syncing PlayerZero with your product or engineering backlogâ€”such as Jira or Azure DevOpsâ€”helps your team prioritize and resolve issues faster by bringing real-world impact into your planning tools.

## How It Works

Once integrated:

- PlayerZero links defects to issues in your backlog, including relevant stack traces and session data.  
- Each issue is enriched with live telemetry and user impact to support better prioritization.  
- Engineers can trace bugs back to code, deployments, and affected users directly from their ticketing system.

## What This Enables

- **Prioritize issues accurately**: Show your team which bugs cause the most user impact.  
- **Accelerate code fixes**: Reference stack traces and session details right inside your product management tool.

_PlayerZero helps bridge the gap between triage and resolutionâ€”without disrupting your existing workflow._
