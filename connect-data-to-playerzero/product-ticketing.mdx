title: "Project Management Tickets"

Syncing PlayerZero with your product or engineering backlogâ€”such as Jira or Azure DevOpsâ€”helps your team correlate the impact of work on your codebase, and by extension, your customers.

## How It Works

Once integrated:

- PlayerZero links backlog tickets to issues and technical context, including relevant stack traces and session data.  
- PlayerZero correlates code changes to past and present work items.

## What This Enables

- **Prioritize issues accurately**: Measure the impact of engineering time based on customer impact.
- **Work transparency**: Connect code states to related work items from the past.
- **Expedited backlog reduction**: Correlate pending code changes to additional opportunities for cleanup.

<Note>PlayerZero helps bridge the gap between triage and resolutionâ€”without disrupting your existing workflow.</Note>
