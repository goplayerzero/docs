description: "Control PlayerZero recording behavior per domain."

## Overview

PlayerZero allows you to control how recording and monitoring behave across different environments by configuring domain-specific settings. This gives your team the ability to enable or disable recording, adjust the visibility of developer tools, and fine-tune telemetry capture for production, staging, QA, and local environments. Use domain access controls to prevent noisy development data from impacting insights and to ensure the right level of monitoring across your deployments.

## Where is this?

You can access these controls under  
[Settings > Web SDK](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/web).

You’ll see a configuration interface that looks like this:

## Domain-Level Controls

Each domain has five configurable properties:

1. **Enabled**  
   Turns PlayerZero recording on or off for that domain.

2. **Production**  
   Labels events from this domain as production data.

3. **Show 'Share Devtools' Button**  
   Enables the floating blue button. This is usually enabled on `localhost` and disabled elsewhere.  
   Use `playerzero.prompt()` to integrate a custom button if needed.

4. **Enable OpenTelemetry Integration**  
   Enables monitoring and event capture.  
   Recommended: **On for production and staging**, **Off for development**.

5. **Dataset**  
   Assign a custom Dataset label to help group events during analysis.

> You can use glob patterns like `*.domain.com` to apply settings across subdomains.

<Warning>
When adding domains:
- Make sure to include `www.` if your production domain includes it.
- The first domain in the list takes precedence — order matters.
</Warning>

## Example Setup

Here’s how PlayerZero configures their environments:

![Domain Config Example](/images/web-sdk-domain-configuration-pz.png)

- `localhost`  
  Monitoring off, share button on.

- `go.playerzero.app`  
  Production enabled, share button hidden and custom embedded.

- `*.playerzero.app`  
  Staging and QA domains. Monitoring on and share button visible.

- `All other domains`  
  Disabled to avoid capturing external or rogue environments.
