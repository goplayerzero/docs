There are two main ways to use the PlayerZero Intercom integration to optimize
your support workflow: Allow a support team member to send a PlayerZero issue
reporting button or automatically send a button to the user based on a message
cue.

### Send our button directly to a user experiencing issues

From the Intercom inbox, simply click the app icon and send the PlayerZero
button:

![](/images/Intercom1.gif "Intercom1.gif")

On the other end, your user will receive a link back to submit the issue!

### Automatically send our button with Operator

Add our button to a custom operator bot:

![View within Intercom](/images/Intercom2.gif "Intercom2.gif")

On the user's end, they will receive an automated PlayerZero upload button!

### Setup

_(Each of the steps are included in your normal onboarding process!)_

1. Login to PlayerZero
2. Create a new project in PlayerZero
3. Embed the PlayerZero Snippet to link your project to your application.
4. Navigate to Settings > Integrations
5. Click "Connect" in the Intercom integration section
6. You will be redirected to the Intercom site where you can install!
