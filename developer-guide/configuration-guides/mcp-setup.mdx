description: "Use PlayerZero to monitor, diagnose, and resolve software issues before they reach your users."

## Prerequisites

- Active PlayerZero account with project access  
- *Editor* or *Owner* permissions in that project  
- An MCP-compatible AI assistant (VS Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.)

---

## Step 1: Create an MCP Token


1. **Open Project Settings**  
   - Log in at https://playerzero.ai 
   - Choose your organization & project  
   - Navigate to **Settings → MCP Tokens**

2. **Generate Token**  
   - Click **New Token**  
   - Give it a descriptive name, e.g. `Cursor MCP` or `Claude Desktop`  
   - Click **Create Token**  
   - **Copy & store the token immediately** – it won’t be shown again.

3. **Token details**  
   - Expires in **90 days**  
   - Scoped to **one** project  
   - Create multiple tokens for different tools or teammates

## Step 2: Configure Your MCP Client

Use the following syntax:
```
{
    "mcp": {

        "inputs": [
            {
                "id": "api-key",
                "type": "promptString",
                "description": "Your API key for the MCP server"
            }
        ],
        "servers": {
            "playerzero": {                      
                "url": "https://playerzero.ai/api/mcp", 
                "headers": {
                    "Authorization": "Bearer [ENTER TOKEN HERE]",
                },
            }
        }
    },
    "chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true
}
```


## Step 3: Available Tools
**`playerzero_status`**: Tests your connection to PlayerZero.
```
Use the playerzero_status tool to check if PlayerZero is working.
```
**Response:**
- "true" if connection is successful
- Error message if there are authentication or connection issues

**`ask_playerzero`**: Query your codebase using PlayerZero's AI.

**Parameters:**
- **`query`** (required): Your question about the codebase
- **`playerId`** (optional): Continue existing conversation
- **`lastMessageId`** (optional): Resume from specific message
Usage Examples:
```
Use ask_playerzero to find all authentication-related files in the codebase.

Use ask_playerzero to explain how the user registration process works.

Use ask_playerzero to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the API routes.
```


## Step 4: Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Conversation Continuity">
	- The ask_playerzero tool returns playerId and lastMessageId in responses
	- Use these values in subsequent queries to maintain conversation context
	- This enables more accurate and contextual responses
	</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Query Optimization">
	- Be specific in your questions for better results
	- Ask about particular files, functions, or architectural patterns
	- Use follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific areas
	- Visit our [Prompting Guides](/user-guides/prompting-basics) for more tips!
	</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Token Management">
	**Token Management**
	- Rotate tokens regularly (every 60-90 days)
	- Use descriptive names to track token usage
	- Delete unused tokens to maintain security
	- Each team member should have their own token
	</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Security Considerations
- **Token Security:** Store MCP tokens securely and never commit them to version control
- **Project Scope:** Tokens only provide access to the specific project they were created for
- **Audit Trail:** All MCP interactions are logged in your PlayerZero project
- **Expiration:** Tokens automatically expire after 90 days for security
