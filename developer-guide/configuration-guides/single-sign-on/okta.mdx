<Note>Organization **Owner** access is required in PlayerZero to configure SSO. **Okta Administrator** access is required in Okta to create the app registration and adjust settings.</Note>

## Overview

This guide walks you through creating an Okta app registration and wiring it to PlayerZero. We use the **OIDC Authorization Code** flow with **PKCE**. PlayerZero only requests standard OIDC claims.

---

## Prerequisites

- A PlayerZero organization where you are an **Owner**
- Admin access to **Okta Portal** for your tenant
- PlayerZero redirect URL: `https://playerzero.ai/api/auth/sso`
---

## Step 1 — Create the App Registration in Okta: 
1. Select Sign-in method `OIDC - OpenID Connect`:
2. Select Application Type as Web registration:

## Step 2 — App Settings 

On the New Web App Integration Screen:
1. Toggle Core Grants:
   - `Authorization Code` 
   - `Refresh Token` 
2. Set redirect URL: `https://playerzero.ai/api/auth/sso`
3. Remove Sign-out redirect URL
4. Toggle `Limit Access to selected groups` and select your PlayerZero (or equivalent) group.
5. Under the newly created App `General` settings tab, toggle on `Require PKCE as additional verification`

## Step 3 — Configure PlayerZero

1. In PlayerZero, open **Settings → SSO Configuration → Add SSO Configuration**.
2. Fill in: `Fetch SSO config from well-known endpoint` with your `Issuer URL` and append `/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
	- Issuer URL can be found under the Security dropdown --> API
3. Click **Fetch from Well-Known** 
4. Verify your organization's domain and other autofilled settings.
5. Enter your `Client ID` and `Client Secret Value`.
6. Add the `openid profile email offline_access` scopes.
7. Toggle on `Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)`.

## Step 4 — Test the Connection

1. In PlayerZero **SSO Configuration**, click **Test Connection**.
2. Complete the Okta sign-in in the popup.
3. On success, click **Save Configuration**.

## Next Steps — Rollout & User Impact

Once SSO is **saved and enabled**, PlayerZero will **invalidate existing sessions**:

- **All users will be logged out** of PlayerZero.
- When users log back in through SSO, they will be able to access all previous work. No data will be lost in the transition.
