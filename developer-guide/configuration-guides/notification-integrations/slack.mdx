## Managing Alert Volume

If you're receiving too many Slack alerts, you can create mute rules to filter out known or non-critical issues while continuing to receive alerts for new problems.

- **Create mute rules** from the Issues page to suppress alerts for specific issues
- **View muted issues** using the filter dropdown on the Issues page
- **Unmute issues** by removing the mute rule from the issue detail page

For detailed instructions, see [Manage Alert Muting](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/notification-integrations/manage-alert-muting).
