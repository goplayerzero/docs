### Setting Up Slack Integration

Follow these simple steps to configure your PlayerZero Slack integration:

#### 1. Enable Slack Integration

In your PlayerZero account:

- Navigate to the **Settings** tab
- Select **Release Alerts**
- Toggle the **Slack integration** ON

#### 2. Authenticate with Slack

- You’ll be redirected to Slack’s authorization screen
- Review and approve the requested permissions for the PlayerZero bot

#### 3. Configure Channel Prefix (Optional)

After enabling Slack, you’ll have the option to configure a **Channel Prefix**.  
This prefix helps PlayerZero automatically create and organize dedicated alert channels in your workspace.

- **Channel Prefix**: Optional. Add up to 4 alphanumeric characters (no dash at the end).
- Helps identify release-related channels by project.
- Especially useful when managing multiple projects within the same Slack workspace.

> Example: Setting a prefix like `web-` would create channels such as `#web-release-alerts`.
