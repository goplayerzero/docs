# Setup Exporters

In OpenTelemetry, **exporters** are components that send your telemetry data (traces, logs, metrics) to an endpoint. By configuring an **OTLP** exporter, you can direct all of your signals to PlayerZero’s backend for processing and correlation.

## Key Concept

- **Exporter**: The mechanism by which your application’s telemetry is transmitted to a third-party system.
- **OTLP**: The default OpenTelemetry protocol for standardizing how data is serialized and sent.

PlayerZero supports the OTLP/HTTP exporter. That means if your application can emit OTLP data over HTTP, it can talk to PlayerZero.

## Exporter Types

Depending on your stack, you might use:

- **SDK-based exporters**  
  Built directly into language-specific OpenTelemetry SDKs (e.g., Java, Node.js).
- **Collector-based exporters**  
  (Where the collector handles forwarding data to PlayerZero.)
- **Third-party or custom exporters**  
  Provided by frameworks or cloud vendors, but still OTLP-compliant.

## Configuration

Typically, you’ll set:

- **otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint** to `https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp`
- **otel.exporter.otlp.headers** to include your PlayerZero API key (e.g., `Authorization=Bearer <your-token>`)
- **otel.traces.exporter**, **otel.logs.exporter**, **otel.metrics.exporter** to `otlp`

For details on how to do this in your specific environment, see:

- [OpenTelemetry Exporters Overview](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/exporters/)
- [Language-Specific Exporters](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/)

## Next Steps

- **[Setup Collectors](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/setup-collectors)**  
  If you need more complex routing or transformations, a collector might be the next step.
- **[Use PlayerZero’s Endpoint](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/playerzero-endpoint)**  
  Finalize the specifics of pointing to PlayerZero’s ingest URL.
- **[Logs, Traces, and Metrics](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/logs-traces-metrics)**  
  See how PlayerZero correlates each signal type with user sessions and code changes.
