# Instrument OpenTelemetry

To make use of PlayerZero’s capabilities around defects, user sessions, and code insights, you first need to **instrument** your application with OpenTelemetry (OTel). Instrumentation is how you create traces, logs, and metrics that capture runtime behavior in your services.

## Why Instrument?

- **Visibility into System Behavior**  
  Generate spans, logs, and metrics that describe how your application executes.
- **Correlate Data with PlayerZero**  
  Forward these signals to PlayerZero, enabling real-time defect detection tied to specific code changes or user sessions.
- **Stay Vendor-Neutral**  
  Keep your telemetry decoupled from any single provider — including us.

## Where to Start

OpenTelemetry has a rich set of documentation explaining how to instrument your code. We suggest starting with:

- [OpenTelemetry Concepts: Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/)
- [Automatic vs. Manual Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/#automatic-instrumentation)

### Recommended: Auto-Instrumentation
Most stacks offer **auto-instrumentation** packages. This is the quickest way to capture traces for common libraries (HTTP, database clients, etc.) without writing custom instrumentation code.

### Manual Instrumentation
If you need more control or your stack doesn’t support auto-instrumentation, you can manually create and link spans. This lets you decide exactly what your traces look like.

## PlayerZero Tip

If you’re using the **PlayerZero Web SDK**, remember to enable **Trace Headers** under **Settings > Web SDK → Enable OpenTelemetry Headers**. This allows the frontend to pass a `traceparent` header into your backend, linking user actions to backend spans automatically.

## Next Steps

1. **[Setup Exporters](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/setup-exporters)**  
   Configure how your newly instrumented code sends data (e.g., OTLP exporter).

2. **[Setup Collectors](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/setup-collectors)**  
   If you need a dedicated collector for more complex routing or transformation.

3. **[Language-Specific Guides](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/recipes)**
