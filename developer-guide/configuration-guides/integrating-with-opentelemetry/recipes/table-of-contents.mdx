# Language-Specific Guides

Setting up OpenTelemetry (OTel) depends heavily on your application's language and architecture.  
This section organizes our documentation by language, helping you quickly find the right starting points.

Each guide below explains:

- Basic OTel setup for your language
- Key links to OpenTelemetry documentation
- How to point your telemetry to PlayerZero once you're collecting signals

If you're newer to OpenTelemetry concepts like **instrumentation**, **exporters**, or **collectors**, you may want to review those sections first for a better mental model.

## Core Concepts to Understand First

Before diving into language-specific details, we recommend getting familiar with these high-level topics:

- **[Instrument OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/instrument-opentelemetry)**  
  Learn about auto-instrumentation, manual spans, and why instrumentation is the first step.

- **[Setup Exporters](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/setup-exporters)**  
  Understand how telemetry data (traces, logs, metrics) is transmitted to endpoints like PlayerZero.

- **[Setup Collectors](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/setup-collectors)**  
  Learn when and why you might use an OpenTelemetry Collector for advanced routing or transformations.

- **[Use PlayerZero’s Endpoint](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/playerzero-endpoint)**  
  Configure your exporters or collectors to point to the PlayerZero backend.

## Next Steps After Instrumenting

Once you’ve instrumented your code and confirmed your telemetry is flowing:

- **[Logs, Traces, and Metrics](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/logs-traces-metrics)**  
  Learn how PlayerZero links telemetry signals with user sessions and code changes.
  
- **[OpenTelemetry Recipes](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/recipes)**  
  Browse example configurations and deeper setup tips.
