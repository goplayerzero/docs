# Setup Collectors

The **OpenTelemetry Collector** is a separate service or agent that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data. It lets you create more sophisticated pipelines, whether you want to filter data, enrich spans, or send to multiple destinations (e.g., PlayerZero + another APM).

## Why Use a Collector?

- **Centralize Configuration**: Manage exporters and pipelines in one place.
- **Enrich or Filter Data**: Add metadata, remove sensitive fields, or apply sampling.
- **Route Telemetry**: Forward to multiple endpoints simultaneously (e.g., PlayerZero and a local monitoring stack).

## PlayerZero Compatibility

If you run a collector, you can configure an **OTLP HTTP exporter** in that collector to send data to `https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp`. Include your PlayerZero API key in the `Authorization` header.

### Example Collector Pipeline

Below is a minimal snippet of a typical `otel-collector-config.yaml`.  
(Adjust to your environment, ensuring the OTLP exporter points to PlayerZero.)

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
      grpc:

processors:
  batch: {}

exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer <your-api-token>

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```
