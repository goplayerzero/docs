# OpenTelemetry for Rust

OpenTelemetry for Rust provides libraries to create and export traces, logs, and metrics. The ecosystem is growing rapidly and supports async-first applications.

## Installation

Add the OpenTelemetry crates to your `Cargo.toml`:

```bash
opentelemetry = "0.20" 
opentelemetry-otlp = "0.13" tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Auto-Instrumentation

<AutoInstrumentation/>

Rust currently does not have "auto-instrumentation" in the same sense as some other languages. You manually wrap your application logic with spans and telemetry.

## Manual Instrumentation

<ManualInstrumentation/>

You can manually create spans and traces in Rust:


```bash
use opentelemetry::{global, trace::Tracer};
let tracer = global::tracer("my-service");
tracer.in_span("my-operation", |_cx| { // your application logic });
```

## Exporters

<ExporterOverview/>

You typically configure the OTLP exporter directly in your Rust code when initializing telemetry.

Key configuration:

```bash
Endpoint: https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp Headers: Authorization=Bearer <your-playerzero-token>
```

## Optional: Using a Collector

<CollectorOptional/>

You can optionally forward telemetry through an OpenTelemetry Collector before reaching PlayerZero.
