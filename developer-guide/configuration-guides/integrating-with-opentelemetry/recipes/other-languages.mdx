# Other Languages

OpenTelemetry supports a wide variety of languages beyond the major ones listed in this section.  
If you're working with C++, Kotlin, Dart, C#, or any other OpenTelemetry-supported stack, you can still connect telemetry to PlayerZero.

## General Approach

The steps are the same no matter the language:

1. **Instrument Your Application**  
   Use your languageâ€™s OpenTelemetry SDK to create spans, logs, and metrics.  
   ðŸ‘‰ Refer to [opentelemetry.io/docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) for detailed instructions per language.

2. **Use an OTLP Exporter**  
   Configure the exporter to send telemetry to PlayerZeroâ€™s endpoint:
   
   - `https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp`
   - With `Authorization: Bearer <your-playerzero-token>`

3. **(Optional) Use a Collector**  
   You can route telemetry through an OpenTelemetry Collector if you want additional processing, enrichment, or multi-destination forwarding.

## Compatibility

PlayerZero accepts:

- **OTLP/HTTP** telemetry  
- Across all major OpenTelemetry signal types: **traces**, **logs**, and **metrics**

If your exporter supports OTLP/HTTP (almost all modern OpenTelemetry SDKs do), you're good to go.
