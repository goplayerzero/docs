# Logs, Traces, and Metrics

PlayerZero supports ingestion of all three primary OpenTelemetry signal types — **logs**, **traces**, and **metrics** — with a clear goal:  
**to help you resolve real user-facing defects faster.**

While traditional observability platforms focus on system health or dashboarding, PlayerZero uses telemetry to **bridge the gap between backend behavior, frontend sessions, and the code that caused them**.

---

## Our Approach

Telemetry is not the end goal — it’s a data stream we correlate with:

- User session timelines  
- Code changes and commits  
- Customer and product tickets  
- Known regressions or previous issues  

By combining signals from OpenTelemetry with PlayerZero’s Web SDK, codebase metadata, and user context, we’re able to surface the full story behind an issue — not just the alert.

---

## Frontend-to-Backend Trace Linking

When the **PlayerZero Web SDK** is installed, it automatically generates and attaches a `traceparent` header to user actions in the browser.

This header enables:
- Traces to link frontend events with backend spans
- Full session timelines to show both UI and system behavior
- Each trace to be mapped to a specific user, page, and action

Once enabled, any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend span can be tied back to:
- A specific user session
- A traceable user action
- A specific release or commit

---

## Trace Support

Traces are the backbone of correlation in PlayerZero.

We support:
- All OTLP-compliant spans
- Root span detection and timing
- Multi-service, multi-language distributed traces
- Linking frontend spans to backend spans via `traceparent`

Once ingested, traces are grouped and analyzed for:
- Latency spikes
- Repeat issues
- Regression patterns
- User impact

Traces appear inside PlayerZero’s issue timeline view and are correlated with other signal types.

---

## Log Support

Logs provide crucial detail around trace events and are often the best way to understand what happened inside a specific function or service.

We support:
- Structured logs sent over OTLP
- Logs that link directly to trace spans
- Standalone log entries for pattern detection

When logs and traces share context (e.g., `trace_id`, `span_id`, or user/session fields), we’ll automatically associate them.

This helps PlayerZero:
- Enrich timeline views with log context
- Group similar logs into recurring issues
- Detect regressions based on log signatures

---

## Metric Support

PlayerZero ingests OTLP-formatted metrics to provide context and detect supporting patterns.

We use metrics to:
- Identify spikes in request latency or error rate
- Surface anomalies that relate to user complaints or failed sessions
- Support trend analysis over time for known issue types

Unlike traditional APM tools, we don’t expose a metrics dashboard. Instead, metrics enhance issue prioritization, timeline context, and long-term pattern recognition.

---

## Example Workflow

A user clicks a button on your site → it sends a `traceparent` to your backend → your backend emits spans and logs via OpenTelemetry → PlayerZero ties everything together.

That one trace may trigger:
- A new issue in PlayerZero if it’s a regression
- A linked session timeline with frontend + backend events
- A devtools view with logs, span durations, and code references

No manual stitching required. You just instrument your app and point telemetry to us.

## Summary Table

| Signal Type | Role in PlayerZero | How We Use It |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Traces**  | Distributed request flow | Correlate user sessions, regressions, backend performance |
| **Logs**    | Detailed system events | Enrich trace context, identify patterns, detect regressions |
| **Metrics** | System-level signals | Detect anomalies and trend shifts tied to user behavior |
