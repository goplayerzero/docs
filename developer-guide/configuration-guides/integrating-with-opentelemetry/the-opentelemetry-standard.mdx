title: "The OpenTelemetry Standard"
description: "PlayerZero is built to support the OpenTelemetry standard for logs, traces, and metrics."
---

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an open-source, vendor-neutral standard for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data. Backed by the CNCF, it’s the industry norm for instrumenting distributed systems.

It unifies three core signal types:

- **Traces** – End-to-end workflows across services
- **Logs** – Structured, timestamped events
- **Metrics** – Numeric signals representing system health

## Why PlayerZero Supports OTel

PlayerZero integrates with OTel to correlate backend telemetry with **real user sessions** in the frontend. By supporting the native OTLP format, we enable you to:

- Use existing OTel exporters or collectors
- Ingest logs, traces, and metrics in real time
- Enrich these signals with user identity and session context
- Connect issues to the commit, release, or function that caused them

You choose how to instrument your code; PlayerZero adds user and code insights to each signal.

## What You Can Send

Anything in the OTel (OTLP) format:

- **Traces (Spans)** – Distributed workflows across services
- **Logs** – Structured log data
- **Metrics** – Health or performance indicators

PlayerZero automatically merges these signals into issues, timelines, and regression analysis.

## Logs, Traces, and Metrics in PlayerZero

While traditional observability platforms excel at dashboards and alerts, PlayerZero focuses on **end-to-end issue resolution**. We bridge your backend data with user sessions and code commits to surface what truly impacts customers.

### Our Approach
We correlate telemetry with:
- User session timelines  
- Frontend events and actions  
- Commit and release data  
- Known or repeating issues  

This unified view helps identify root causes without toggling between multiple tools.

### Frontend-to-Backend Trace Linking
The **PlayerZero Web SDK** attaches a `traceparent` header to user actions. This:
- Links frontend events to backend spans  
- Shows end-to-end timelines spanning UI and system layers  
- Maps traces to specific users, pages, and releases  

### Trace Support
- Accept all OTLP-compliant spans  
- Detect root spans, measure latency, track multi-service requests  
- Highlight repeat issues and performance spikes  

Traces appear inside PlayerZero’s issue view and tie directly to user sessions.

### Log Support
- Ingest structured OTLP logs  
- Associate them automatically to traces via `trace_id` or user/session context  
- Group recurring log entries to identify patterns or regressions  

Logs give deeper context alongside traces and user actions in one place.

### Metric Support
- Accept OTLP metrics (e.g., CPU usage, error rate, latency)  
- Surface spikes and anomalies that align with real user impact  
- No standalone dashboard: metrics are used to enrich issue timelines and triage  

## Example Workflow

1. **User Action**: A user clicks a button in the browser (Web SDK adds `traceparent`).  
2. **Backend Spans/Logs**: The server emits spans and logs via OTel.  
3. **Automatic Correlation**: PlayerZero merges frontend + backend data in real time.  

If the request fails, PlayerZero can:
- Flag a new or regressed issue  
- Show the full session + logs + traces  
- Reveal code commits causing the error
