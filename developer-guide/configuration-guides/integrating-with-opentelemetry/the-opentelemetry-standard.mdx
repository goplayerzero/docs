title: "The OpenTelemetry Standard"
description: "PlayerZero is built to support the OpenTelemetry standard for logs, traces, and metrics."

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an open-source, vendor-neutral standard for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data. Backed by the CNCF, it has quickly become the industry standard for instrumenting distributed systems.

It provides a unified way to collect:

- **Traces** – End-to-end workflows across services and systems
- **Logs** – Structured, timestamped events that offer detail and context
- **Metrics** – Numeric signals that represent system health and usage

## Why PlayerZero Supports OTel

OpenTelemetry is not just a standard — it’s the foundation for a shared understanding of how your system behaves.

PlayerZero integrates with OpenTelemetry to unlock a specific value:  
**connecting backend telemetry with frontend sessions, users, and code.**

By aligning with the OTel standard:
- We plug into your existing instrumentation, exporters, or collectors
- We ingest logs, traces, and metrics using the native OTLP format
- We correlate telemetry with user identity and session data from our Web SDK
- We tie those signals back to the exact commit, release, or function that caused them

You instrument how you want — manual spans, auto-instrumentation, custom logs — and PlayerZero receives those signals in real time, enriching them with user and code context.

## What You Can Send

As long as it follows the OTLP format, you can send:
- **Traces (Spans)** – Distributed request flows
- **Logs** – Structured backend logging
- **Metrics** – System behavior or service-level indicators

These signals are routed to PlayerZero’s ingest pipeline, where they’re merged into issue timelines, defect analysis, and regression detection.

## What’s Next?

Once you’ve instrumented your stack, you can begin forwarding data to PlayerZero:

- **[Use PlayerZero’s Endpoint](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/playerzero-endpoint)**  
  Configure your OTLP exporter to point to our backend.

- **[Logs, Traces, and Metrics](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/logs-traces-metrics)**  
  See how PlayerZero puts telemetry to use in defect workflows.
