# Use PlayerZero’s Endpoint

Every team’s OpenTelemetry setup looks a little different — and that’s the point. OTel is meant to be flexible, so whether you rely on manual instrumentation, auto-instrumentation, custom collectors, or language-specific agents:

> **If your telemetry is OpenTelemetry-compliant, you can forward it to PlayerZero.**

PlayerZero then enriches that data with user sessions, code insights, and issue analysis.

---

## Step 1: Instrument OpenTelemetry

To use PlayerZero’s capabilities around defects, user sessions, and code insights, you first need to **instrument** your application with OTel. Instrumentation generates the traces, logs, and metrics that capture your application’s runtime behavior.

### Where to Start
- Check out [OpenTelemetry Concepts: Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/)  
- Decide on [Automatic vs. Manual Instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation/#automatic-instrumentation)

### Recommended Setup: Auto-Instrumentation
We suggest **auto-instrumentation** for supported stacks. It requires minimal effort and immediately starts capturing meaningful signals like HTTP and database spans.

### Manual Instrumentation
If your language or frameworks don’t fully support auto-instrumentation—or if you need custom spans—manual instrumentation lets you precisely define what’s captured. This can be more work but offers granular control.

### PlayerZero Tip
If you’re using the **PlayerZero Web SDK**, be sure to enable **Trace Headers** under **Settings > Web SDK → Enable OpenTelemetry Headers**. This allows the frontend to pass a `traceparent` header to your backend, linking user actions to backend spans automatically.

---

## Step 2: Configure the PlayerZero Endpoint

Once you’ve confirmed your app is emitting OTel data (via auto or manual instrumentation), you’re ready to **point your exporter** at PlayerZero.

### Understanding Your Configuration Context
OpenTelemetry supports many configuration methods:

- `.properties` files (e.g., Java, Spring Boot)
- Environment variables (e.g., Node.js, Docker)
- YAML configs (e.g., `otel-config.yaml`)
- CLI flags or Helm charts (Kubernetes)
- OpenTelemetry Collector pipelines

Wherever you set these values, the goal is to direct OTel signals to PlayerZero’s **OTLP** endpoint.

### Required OTLP Config

```properties
otel.service.name=MyServiceName
otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp
otel.exporter.otlp.headers=Authorization=Bearer <your-api-token>
otel.traces.exporter=otlp
otel.logs.exporter=otlp
otel.metrics.exporter=otlp
```

> **Note:** Your API token is available in the PlayerZero dashboard under **Settings → API Keys**.

---

## How It Works

Once your exporter is configured:

- **Telemetry Flow**: OTel sends traces, logs, and metrics directly to PlayerZero’s OTLP endpoint.
- **Frontend Linking**: If the Web SDK is enabled, frontend user sessions automatically link to backend spans via `traceparent`.
- **Intelligent Analysis**: PlayerZero analyzes incoming telemetry for anomalies, regressions, and user-facing defects, surfacing them with full session context.

> You can also duplicate telemetry to other observability platforms — simply configure multiple exporters if needed.
