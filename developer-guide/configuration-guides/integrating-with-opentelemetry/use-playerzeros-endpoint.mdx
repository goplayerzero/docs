# Use PlayerZero’s Endpoint

Every team’s OpenTelemetry setup looks a little different — and that’s a good thing. OpenTelemetry is built to be flexible and support a wide range of deployment patterns.

Whether you’re using manual instrumentation, automatic injection, a custom collector, or language-specific agents, the good news is:

> **If your telemetry is OpenTelemetry-compliant, you can forward it to PlayerZero.**

---

## Recommended Setup

We recommend starting with **auto-instrumentation** if your stack supports it. This approach requires the least custom code and captures meaningful signals like traces and network spans out of the box.

That said, PlayerZero works with:
- Manually instrumented spans
- Service-specific SDKs
- Agent-based injection
- Third-party collectors

Once you’ve instrumented your app and confirmed that telemetry is flowing correctly, you’re ready to point your exporter at the PlayerZero endpoint.

## Endpoint Configuration

To send OpenTelemetry data to PlayerZero, you’ll configure your exporter to use the following values:

## Understanding Your Configuration Context

There’s no single way to configure OpenTelemetry — and that’s by design. Depending on your stack, you might be setting these values in:

- A `.properties` file (e.g. Java, Spring Boot)
- Environment variables (e.g. Node.js, containerized apps)
- A `otel-config.yaml` file
- CLI flags or Helm charts (for Kubernetes)
- Your OpenTelemetry Collector configuration

However you’re wiring things up, the values below are what PlayerZero expects when receiving data via the OTLP protocol.


### Required OTLP Config

```properties
otel.service.name=MyServiceName
otel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=https://sdk.playerzero.app/otlp
otel.exporter.otlp.headers=Authorization=Bearer <your-api-token>
otel.traces.exporter=otlp
otel.logs.exporter=otlp
otel.metrics.exporter=otlp
```
### How This Works

Once configured:
- OpenTelemetry will send logs, traces, and metrics to PlayerZero
- The Web SDK (if enabled) will link user sessions to backend spans
- PlayerZero will analyze the data for anomalies, regressions, and context-rich debugging paths

You can combine this with other exporters if you want to duplicate telemetry to your existing APM or logging provider.
Your API token can be found in the PlayerZero dashboard under Settings > API Keys.

## Next Steps

Now that your exporter is pointing to PlayerZero, here are a few places to go next:

- **[Logs, Traces, and Metrics](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/logs-traces-metrics)**  
  Learn how PlayerZero ingests and uses each signal type to detect regressions, correlate user issues, and surface anomalies.

- **[Exporters and Collectors](/docs/integrations/opentelemetry/exporters-and-collectors)**  
  Dive deeper into exporter options, advanced configurations, and how to forward data from custom collectors.
