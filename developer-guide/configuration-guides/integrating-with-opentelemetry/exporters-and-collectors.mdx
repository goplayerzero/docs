# Exporters and Collectors

OpenTelemetry uses **exporters** and **collectors** to send telemetry data — including traces, logs, and metrics — to external systems like PlayerZero.

PlayerZero supports **any OpenTelemetry-compliant exporter or collector** that emits data using the [OTLP protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otlp/).

That includes:
- SDK-based exporters (Java, Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- The OpenTelemetry Collector
- Vendor-agnostic proxy layers

You don’t need to install any special agent or binary from PlayerZero. Just configure your pipeline to forward data to our endpoint.
