   - Your selection is saved and persists across browser sessions

4. **Verify connection**

## Step 4: Verify It's Working

Try a quick test to confirm everything is connected:

1. Open any webpage you'd like to analyze
2. Open the side panel (click the PlayerZero icon)
3. Click the **full page capture** button on the floating toolbar (page icon with a plus)
4. Type a question like "What does this page do?" in the side panel
5. Click **Submit** — a new AI Player session will be created

If the Player starts successfully, you're all set.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Token Management">
- Rotate tokens regularly — they expire after **90 days**
- Use descriptive names to track which token is used where
- Each team member should have their own token
- Delete unused tokens from **Settings → User Settings → Personal Access Tokens**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Usage Tips">
- **Capture before asking:** Attach page context to give the AI Player more to work with
- **Use partial capture** to focus on a specific error message, component, or section rather than the full page
- **Check the badge** — the orange badge count tells you how many Players need your input
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Browser Permissions">
- The extension needs access to all URLs to render the floating toolbar and capture page content
- It communicates only with `playerzero.ai` — no data is sent to third parties
- Page content is converted to a readable format locally in the browser before being sent to the API
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="I don't see the floating toolbar">
The toolbar only appears when the **side panel is open**. Click the PlayerZero icon in your Chrome toolbar to open it. If the side panel is already open and you still don't see the toolbar, try refreshing the page.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My token isn't accepted">
- Ensure the token starts with `pz_pat` — tokens without this prefix will be rejected
- Check that the token hasn't expired (90-day lifetime)
- Verify you have **Editor** or **Owner** permissions on the project
- Generate a new token if needed from **Settings → User Settings → Personal Access Tokens** in the web app
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The page seems frozen or my cursor looks different">
You're in **partial capture mode**. Press **Escape** to exit and return to normal browsing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Capture doesn't work on certain sites">
Some websites have strict Content Security Policies that may interfere with the extension's ability to read page content. This is a browser-level restriction. Try using full page capture instead of partial capture, or manually describe the page content in your question.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Badge count isn't updating">
The badge updates every 30 seconds and requires a valid token. If your token has expired or been removed, the badge will clear. Re-enter a valid token in the extension settings.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Security

- **Token security:** Store your Personal Access Token securely and never share it
- **Project scope:** Tokens only provide access to the specific project they were created for
- **Data handling:** Captured page content is processed locally in the browser and sent to PlayerZero over HTTPS
- **Expiration:** Tokens automatically expire after 90 days
