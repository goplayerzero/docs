## Required Permissions

<Note>PlayerZero connects to Bitbucket using OAuth and inherits permissions from the authenticated user. Admin access is **not required** unless restricted repositories need to be accessed.</Note>

When connecting Bitbucket, PlayerZero uses your existing user permissions. No additional scopes are requested beyond what your account already has access to.

PlayerZero leverages these permissions to:

1. Read repository files and structure  
2. Analyze pull requests and post automated comments  
3. Access basic account metadata (e.g., username, email)

<Note>
Access is limited to only the repositories you explicitly select during the OAuth authorization process. PlayerZero does not request or retain broader access than what your Bitbucket user account already has permission to see.
</Note>

## Basic Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

1. A PlayerZero account. You can get started by [creating an account](https://go.playerzero.app).
2. Admin access to your Bitbucket workspace to:

- Authorize OAuth applications
- Grant repository access permissions
- Configure integration settings

### 1. Authorize PlayerZero OAuth Application

Connect your Bitbucket workspace to PlayerZero through OAuth:

1. Navigate to Settings → Code in your PlayerZero dashboard
2. Select Bitbucket from the available SCM providers
3. Click "Connect to Bitbucket" - this will redirect you to Bitbucket's OAuth authorization page
4. Select your Bitbucket workspace
5. Review the requested permissions and click "Grant access"
6. You'll be redirected back to PlayerZero with authorization complete

### 2. Configure Repository Access

After OAuth authorization, configure which repositories PlayerZero should monitor:

<Note>About Projects: A project in PlayerZero is a workspace that combines your application's repositories with telemetry data, user sessions, and ticketing systems. Connect repositories and tickets that are relevant to your project's monitoring goals to correlate code changes, user behavior, and reported issues.</Note>

    1. Navigate to Repository Settings
        - Go to your project Settings → Repositories

    2. Import Repositories
        - In the "Import Repository" section, click the "Select a Provider" dropdown
        - Choose your Azure DevOps organization from the list
        - PlayerZero will display all available repositories from your organization

    3. Add and Configure Repositories
        - Click "Import" next to each repository you want to monitor
        - Select repositories containing code relevant to your project (frontend, backend, or full-stack repos)
        - For each connected repository in the "Connected Repositories" section:
            - Set Primary Branch: Click the branch button (e.g., "main") to select which branch to monitor
            - Toggle Active Status: Use the toggle switch to enable/disable monitoring

<Note>
PlayerZero only accesses repositories you explicitly grant permission to. Repository data is not imported until you enable specific repositories in your PlayerZero settings.
</Note>

### 3. Repository Synchronization

Once enabled, PlayerZero will begin importing and analyzing your repository data:

1. Initial sync may take several minutes to hours depending on repository size
2. PlayerZero will sync new commits and pull requests automatically
3. Monitor progress in the Settings → Code section

### Token Management - OAuth Token Refresh

#### PlayerZero automatically manages OAuth token refresh:

    - OAuth tokens are refreshed automatically when they expire
    - No manual intervention required for token management
    - If authorization fails, you'll receive a notification to re-authorize

#### Re-authorization

If you need to re-authorize the connection:

1. Navigate to Settings → Code in your PlayerZero dashboard
2. Find your Bitbucket connection and click "Reconnect"
3. Follow the OAuth flow again to re-establish the connection

### Bitbucket Server Setup

For Bitbucket Server installations, additional configuration may be required:

#### Prerequisites:

    - Bitbucket Server with API access enabled
    - Network connectivity between PlayerZero and your Bitbucket Server instance
    - Admin access to configure OAuth applications

#### Server Configuration:

Contact PlayerZero support for assistance with Bitbucket Server configuration, as it requires custom OAuth application setup and network configuration.

These permissions enable PlayerZero to provide code analysis, pull request insights, and AI-powered code conversations while maintaining security and access control within your Bitbucket environment.
