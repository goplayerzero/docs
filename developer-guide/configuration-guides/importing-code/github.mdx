GitHub is a cloud-based Git repository hosting service to store and manage source code, with tools for collaboration.

<Note>Admin permissions are required on your GitHub organization to install the PlayerZero GitHub App.</Note>

## Basic Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
1. A PlayerZero account. You can get started by [creating an account](https://go.playerzero.app).
2. Admin access to your GitHub organization to:
        - Install the PlayerZero GitHub App
        - Grant repository access permissions
        - Configure webhook notifications
    
### 1. Install the PlayerZero GitHub App

PlayerZero uses a GitHub App installation for secure, granular access to your repositories.

    1. Navigate to Settings → Code in your PlayerZero dashboard
    2. Select GitHub from the available SCM providers
    3. Click Install GitHub App - this will redirect you to GitHub
    4. Select your GitHub organization and choose which repositories to grant access to
    5. Click Install to complete the GitHub App installation

### 2. Configure Repository Access
After installing the GitHub App, configure which repositories PlayerZero should monitor.

    1. Return to the Settings → Code section in PlayerZero
    2. Toggle on the repositories you want PlayerZero to analyze
    3. Select the primary branch for each repository (typically main or master)

<Note>
PlayerZero only accesses repositories you explicitly grant permission to. Repository data is not imported until you enable specific repositories in your PlayerZero settings.
</Note>

### 3. Repository Synchronization

Once enabled, PlayerZero will begin importing and analyzing your repository data.

    1. Initial sync may take several minutes to hours depending on repository size
    2. PlayerZero will sync new commits and pull requests automatically
    3. Monitor progress in the Settings → Code section

## GitHub Enterprise Setup

For GitHub Enterprise Server installations, additional configuration is required:

    1. GitHub Enterprise Server with API access enabled
    2. Network connectivity between PlayerZero and your GitHub Enterprise instance
    3. Admin access to create GitHub Apps on your Enterprise instance

### Enterprise Configuration Steps

    1. Contact PlayerZero support to configure Enterprise settings
    2. Provide your GitHub Enterprise Server URL and network details
    3. Create a GitHub App on your Enterprise instance with the required permissions
    4. Configure webhook URLs and authentication secrets
    5. Follow the standard repository configuration process above

### Required Permissions

    1. Repository permissions:
        - Contents: Read (access repository files and code)
        - Metadata: Read (repository information)
        - Pull requests: Read & Write (analyze PRs and post comments)
        - Commits: Read (track code changes)

    2. Organization permissions:
        - Members: Read (understand team structure)

These permissions enable PlayerZero to provide code analysis, pull request insights, and AI-powered code conversations while maintaining security and access control.
