## Required Permissions

<Note>Admin permissions are required on your GitHub organization to install the PlayerZero GitHub App.</Note>

PlayerZero requires specific permissions to deliver its full functionality. The PlayerZero GitHub App requests the following permissions:

    1. Repository permissions:
        - Contents: Read (access repository files and code)
        - Metadata: Read (repository information)
        - Pull requests: Read & Write (analyze PRs and post comments)
        - Commits: Read (track code changes)

    2. Organization permissions:
        - Members: Read (understand team structure)

These permissions enable PlayerZero to provide code analysis, pull request insights, and AI-powered code conversations while maintaining security and access control.

## Basic Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
1. A PlayerZero account. You can get started by [creating an account](https://go.playerzero.app).
2. Admin access to your GitHub organization to:
        - Install the PlayerZero GitHub App
        - Grant repository access permissions
        - Configure webhook notifications
    
### 1. Install the PlayerZero GitHub App

PlayerZero uses a GitHub App installation for secure, granular access to your repositories.

    1. Navigate to Settings → Code in your PlayerZero dashboard
    2. Select GitHub from the available SCM providers
    3. Click Install GitHub App - this will redirect you to GitHub
    4. Select your GitHub organization and choose which repositories to grant access to
    5. Click Install to complete the GitHub App installation

### 2. Configure Repository Access
After installing the GitHub App, configure which repositories PlayerZero should monitor.

<Note>About Projects: A project in PlayerZero is a workspace that combines your application's repositories with telemetry data, user sessions, and ticketing systems. Connect repositories and tickets that are relevant to your project's monitoring goals to correlate code changes, user behavior, and reported issues.</Note>

    1. Navigate to Repository Settings
        - Go to your project Settings → Repositories

    2. Import Repositories
        - In the "Import Repository" section, click the "Select a Provider" dropdown
        - Choose your Github organization from the list
        - PlayerZero will display all available repositories from your organization

    3. Add and Configure Repositories
        - Click "Import" next to each repository you want to monitor
        - Select repositories containing code relevant to your project (frontend, backend, or full-stack repos)
        - For each connected repository in the "Connected Repositories" section:
            - Set Primary Branch: Click the branch button (e.g., "main") to select which branch to monitor
            - Toggle Active Status: Use the toggle switch to enable/disable monitoring


<Note>
PlayerZero only accesses repositories you explicitly grant permission to. Repository data is not imported until you enable specific repositories in your PlayerZero settings.
</Note>

### 3. Repository Synchronization

Once enabled, PlayerZero will begin importing and analyzing your repository data.

    1. Initial sync may take several minutes to hours depending on repository size
    2. PlayerZero will sync new commits and pull requests automatically
    3. Monitor progress in the Settings → Code section

## GitHub Enterprise Setup

For GitHub Enterprise Server installations, additional configuration is required:

    1. GitHub Enterprise Server with API access enabled
    2. Network connectivity between PlayerZero and your GitHub Enterprise instance
    3. Admin access to create GitHub Apps on your Enterprise instance

### Enterprise Configuration Steps

    1. Contact PlayerZero support to configure Enterprise settings
    2. Provide your GitHub Enterprise Server URL and network details
    3. Create a GitHub App on your Enterprise instance with the required permissions
    4. Configure webhook URLs and authentication secrets
    5. Follow the standard repository configuration process above

The same permissions listed above apply to GitHub Enterprise installations. These permissions enable PlayerZero to provide code analysis, pull request insights, and AI-powered code conversations while maintaining security and access control.
