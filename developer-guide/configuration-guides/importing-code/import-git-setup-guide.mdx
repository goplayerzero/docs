## Overview

This guide walks you through connecting your source code to PlayerZero. Once integrated, youâ€™ll be able to use the PlayerZero chat feature to ask questions about your codebase. To learn more about how PlayerZero accesses and uses your code, see the [Source Control Management](/connect-data-to-playerzero/source-control-management) overview.

## Supported SCM Connectors

PlayerZero currently supports integration with the following source control providers:

- **GitHub**
- **GitLab**
- **Bitbucket**
- **Azure Repos**

If your organization uses one of these systems, you can connect it directly during setup.

## Basic Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
1. A PlayerZero account. You can get started by [creating an account](https://go.playerzero.app).
2. Sufficient permissions to grant PlayerZero read access to your code and read/write access for managing pull requests in your SCM system.

### 1. Connect Your Code
The primary step is to grant PlayerZero access to your Source Control Management system. You may have already connected an SCM system during the signup process. If so, you can skip directly to enabling specific repositories. To get started, go to the [Settings page](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/repos).

1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab in PlayerZero and select the **Code** anchor.
2. Select your SCM system (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, etc.) when prompted.

### 2. Enable Specific Repositories
After connecting your SCM, select which repositories PlayerZero should monitor.

1. On the **Settings** tab inside the **Code** anchor, toggle on the repositories you want to ingest.
2. Choose the primary reference branch (e.g., Main or Master).

### 3. Allow for Ingestion
Once youâ€™ve enabled your repositories, PlayerZero will begin analyzing the code to surface relevant insights. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size and complexity of your repositories.
