## Overview

PlayerZero integrates with **self-hosted GitLab** so you can leverage AI-powered insights and ask questions about your codebase. Your code remains secure—PlayerZero analyzes it without mirroring repositories externally.

<Note>**Developer permissions required** on any repository you want to connect.</Note>

## Prerequisites

1. **PlayerZero Account** – [Create one](https://go.playerzero.app) if needed
2. **Admin Access** – Admin rights on repositories you plan to connect
3. **Personal Access Token** – GitLab PAT with **`api`** and **`write_repository`** scopes
4. **Network Access** – Your GitLab server must be connected to the internet and reachable from PlayerZero

## Setup Steps

### 1. Connect GitLab
1. Go to **Settings → Code** in PlayerZero
2. Click **Connect GitLab** → **Self-hosted GitLab**

### 2. Configure Connection
- Enter your **Personal Access Token** (with `api` and `write_repository` scopes)
- Add your **GitLab URL** (e.g., `https://gitlab.example.com`)
- Click **Validate** to verify connectivity

### 3. Enable Repositories
1. Select repositories from the list (archived repos excluded)
2. Choose primary branch (e.g., `main`)
3. Click **Import**

Processing begins immediately and takes minutes to hours depending on repository size.

## What Happens Next?

- **Automatic PAT Rotation** – Weekly security rotation every Monday
- **Code Analysis** – PlayerZero analyzes repositories for AI insights
- **Chat Ready** – Ask questions about your codebase once ingestion completes
