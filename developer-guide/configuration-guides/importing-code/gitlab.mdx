## Required Permissions

<Note>Admin access to your GitLab instance is required to create Personal Access Tokens with the necessary permissions.</Note>

PlayerZero requires specific permissions through a GitLab Personal Access Token (PAT). When creating your PAT, ensure the following scopes are enabled:

1. API permissions:
    - api (full API access for repository and merge request operations)
    
2. Repository permissions:
    - write_repository (read repository content and post merge request comments)

<Note>
You must have at least Developer level access to the GitLab projects you want to connect. These permissions enable PlayerZero to read your code, analyze merge requests, and provide automated insights directly in your development workflow.
</Note>

## Basic Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
1. A PlayerZero account. You can get started by [creating an account](https://go.playerzero.app).
2. Admin access to your Bitbucket workspace to:
- Authorize OAuth applications
- Grant repository access permissions
- Configure integration settings

### 1. Create a Personal Access Token

Create a PAT in GitLab with the required permissions:

1. Sign in to your GitLab instance
2. Navigate to User Settings → Access Tokens (or Profile → Access Tokens)
3. Click "Create personal access token" and configure:
    - Token name: PlayerZero Integration
    - Expiration date: Set appropriate expiration (1 year recommended)
    - Scopes: Select the following permissions:
        - api (complete API access)
        - write_repository (read repository content and write to repository)
4. Click "Create personal access token" and copy the generated token immediately

### 2. Configure PlayerZero Integration

Connect your GitLab instance to PlayerZero:

1. Navigate to Settings → Code in your PlayerZero dashboard
2. Select GitLab from the available SCM providers
3. Choose your GitLab type:
    - Cloud GitLab (for GitLab.com)
    - Self-hosted GitLab (for your own GitLab instance)
4. If using self-hosted GitLab, enter your GitLab URL (e.g., https://gitlab.example.com)
5. Paste your Personal Access Token
6. Click "Add Connector" to establish the connection

### 3. Configure Repository Access

After connecting GitLab, configure which repositories PlayerZero should monitor:

<Note>About Projects: A project in PlayerZero is a workspace that combines your application's repositories with telemetry data, user sessions, and ticketing systems. Connect repositories and tickets that are relevant to your project's monitoring goals to correlate code changes, user behavior, and reported issues.</Note>

    1. Navigate to Repository Settings
        - Go to your project Settings → Repositories

    2. Import Repositories
        - In the "Import Repository" section, click the "Select a Provider" dropdown
        - Choose your Azure DevOps organization from the list
        - PlayerZero will display all available repositories from your organization

    3. Add and Configure Repositories
        - Click "Import" next to each repository you want to monitor
        - Select repositories containing code relevant to your project (frontend, backend, or full-stack repos)
        - For each connected repository in the "Connected Repositories" section:
            - Set Primary Branch: Click the branch button (e.g., "main") to select which branch to monitor
            - Toggle Active Status: Use the toggle switch to enable/disable monitoring

<Note>
PlayerZero only accesses repositories where you have at least Developer permissions. Repository data is not imported until you enable specific repositories in your PlayerZero settings.
</Note>

### 4. Repository Synchronization

Once enabled, PlayerZero will begin importing and analyzing your repository data:

1. Initial sync may take several minutes to hours depending on repository size
2. PlayerZero will sync new commits and merge requests automatically
3. Monitor progress in the Settings → Code section


### Self-hosted GitLab Setup

For self-hosted GitLab instances, additional considerations apply:

#### Prerequisites:

    - GitLab instance accessible via HTTP/HTTPS
    - Network connectivity between PlayerZero and your GitLab instance
    - Admin access to create Personal Access Tokens

#### Network Requirements

    - Your GitLab instance must be accessible by PlayerZero
    - If your GitLab instance is behind a firewall, contact PlayerZero support for IP whitelisting
    - HTTPS is strongly recommended for security

### Token Management - Token Rotation

PlayerZero supports automatic token rotation for GitLab:

    - If enabled, PlayerZero will automatically rotate your PAT before expiration
    - Manual token updates can be done through Settings → Code
    - Contact support if you encounter token rotation issues

These permissions enable PlayerZero to provide code analysis, merge request insights, and AI-powered code conversations while maintaining security and access control within your GitLab environment.
