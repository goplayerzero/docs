# Link Project Management Tools

Integrating your project management tools with PlayerZero lets you sync:

- Issues and bugs logged by your team
- Stories and features being worked on
- Internal feedback and improvement tickets
- Release activities linked to engineering work

By connecting your project management system, PlayerZero builds a complete map between user sessions, defects, and ongoing development activities — helping you understand risk earlier and resolve issues faster.
