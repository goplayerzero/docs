title: "Azure DevOps Ticketing Integration"
description: "Connect Azure DevOps Ticketing to PlayerZero for real-time work item sync, defect traceability, and AI-powered debugging."
---

## Overview

The Azure DevOps integration creates a **two-way bridge** between Azure Boards and PlayerZero.  
Once connected, PlayerZero will:

- **Import** work items like user stories, bugs, and tasks in near real-time  
- **Link** user-facing defects to the exact Azure DevOps item that introduced them  
- **Surface** item status, assignee, and priority inside every PlayerZero incident  

> By unifying production signals with your backlog, PlayerZero helps teams triage faster and ship with confidence.
