title: "Integrate Jira Service Management"
description: "Connect Jira Software projects to PlayerZero for real-time issue sync, defect traceability, and AI-powered debugging."
---

## Overview

The Jira integration creates a **two-way bridge** between Jira Software and PlayerZero.  
Once connected, PlayerZero will:

- **Import** issues, stories, epics, and sprints in near real-time  
- **Link** user-facing defects to the exact Jira ticket that introduced them  
- **Surface** ticket status, assignee, and priority inside every PlayerZero incident  

> By unifying production signals with your backlog, PlayerZero helps teams triage faster and ship with confidence.
