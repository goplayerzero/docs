## 1. Overview

- **Key benefits**:
  - Quick setup for static sites or simple HTML/CSS/JS projects.
  - Lightweight and ideal for sites not using npm or frameworks.
- **Who this is for**: Developers working with raw HTML or sites without bundlers like Webpack, Vite, or Parcel.

## 2. Basic Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- A basic HTML file where you can add script tags.
- Your PlayerZero Project ID from the dashboard.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Add the PlayerZero Script Tag

Paste this inside your `<head>` or just before `</body>`:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.playerzero.app/sdk-web.js"></script>
```

#### 2. Initialize PlayerZero

```html
<script>
  PlayerZero.init("your project id here");
</script>
```

#### 3. Identify the User (Optional)

If you know the user’s identity, add this snippet after initialization:

```html
<script>
  PlayerZero.identify("user-id", {
    name: "Jane Doe",
    email: "jane@example.com",
    group: "Marketing",
  });
</script>

You’re all set! PlayerZero will now begin tracking sessions and linking them to your dashboard.
