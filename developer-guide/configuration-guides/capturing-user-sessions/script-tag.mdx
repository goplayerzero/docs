description: "This guide walks you through setting up the PlayerZero SDK using a script tag to start monitoring and improving your frontend applications."

## Prerequisites
- Access to your projectâ€™s HTML codebase.
- Your PlayerZero [Project ID](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/web).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Add the PlayerZero Script

Paste this inside your `<head>` or just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.playerzero.app/sdk-web.js"></script>
```
### 2. Initialize the SDK

Insert the initialization script after loading the PlayerZero SDK:

```html
<script>
  PlayerZero.init("your project id here");
</script>
```

### 3. Identify the User (Recommended)

Once the user is authenticated or known:

```html
<script>
  PlayerZero.identify("user-id", {
    name: "Jane Doe",
    email: "jane@example.com",
    group: "Marketing",
  });
</script>
```

## Next Steps

Once the SDK is installed and initialized, you can visit the [Users page](https://go.playerzero.app/users) in PlayerZero to see live user sessions being captured.

If you want to control where PlayerZero is active, visit the [Domain Settings](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/capturing-user-sessions/domain-settings) guide to configure domain-level access and environment-specific behavior.

Want to extend your integration further? Explore the [Advanced SDK Usage](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/capturing-user-sessions/advanced-usage) guide to unlock features like custom event tracking, devtools links, and user metadata enhancements.
