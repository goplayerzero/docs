description: "This guide walks you through setting up the PlayerZero SDK using npm to start monitoring and improving your frontend applications."
---

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm or yarn installed.
- Access to your project’s frontend codebase.
- Your PlayerZero [API Key](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/api-tokens).

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Install the SDK

```bash npm
npm i @goplayerzero/sdk-web --save
```

### 2. Initialize the SDK

Insert this early in your application’s entry point (e.g., index.js, main.ts, App.vue, etc.):

```javascript
import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";
PlayerZero.init("your project id here");
```

**Important:** PlayerZero.init should only be called once.
Use PlayerZero.isInitialized() to check if initialization has occurred.

### 3. Identify the User (Recommended)
Once the user is authenticated or known:


```javascript
PlayerZero.identify("user-id", {
  name: "Jane Doe",
  email: "jane@example.com",
  group: "Engineering",
});

```

## Next Steps

Once the SDK is installed and initialized, you can visit the [Users page](https://go.playerzero.app/users) in PlayerZero to see live user sessions being captured.

If you want to control where PlayerZero is active, visit the [Domain Settings](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/capturing-user-sessions/domain-settings) guide to configure domain-level access and environment-specific behavior.

Want to extend your integration further? Explore the [Advanced SDK Usage](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/capturing-user-sessions/advanced-usage) guide to unlock features like custom event tracking, devtools links, and user metadata enhancements.
