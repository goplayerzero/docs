## Overview
- **What this section is for**: Guide you through integrating PlayerZero into your app using the `@goplayerzero/sdk-web` npm package.
- **Key benefits**:
  - Seamless SDK setup for modern JavaScript frameworks.
  - Full access to PlayerZero’s API including identity tracking, event logging, and session linking.
- **Who this is for**: Developers working in React, Angular, Vue, or other bundler-based frontend stacks.

## Basic Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm or yarn installed.
- Access to your project’s frontend codebase.
- Your PlayerZero Project ID.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Install the SDK

```bash npm
npm i @goplayerzero/sdk-web --save
```

#### 2. Initialize the SDK

Insert this early in your application’s entry point (e.g., index.js, main.ts, App.vue, etc.):

```javascript
import PlayerZero from "@goplayerzero/sdk-web";
PlayerZero.init("your project id here");
```

**Important:** PlayerZero.init should only be called once.
Use PlayerZero.isInitialized() to check if initialization has occurred.

#### 3. Identify the User (Recommended)
Once the user is authenticated or known:


```javascript
PlayerZero.identify("user-id", {
  name: "Jane Doe",
  email: "jane@example.com",
  group: "Engineering",
});

```
