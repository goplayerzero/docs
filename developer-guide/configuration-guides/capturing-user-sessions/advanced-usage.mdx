## Overview

The PlayerZero Web SDK offers a range of advanced methods beyond basic initialization, giving you greater flexibility and control over how user sessions, analytics events, and devtools integrations are handled. This guide is for developers looking to extend PlayerZero’s functionality, troubleshoot edge cases, and build custom workflows on top of PlayerZero’s core capabilities.

## Advanced SDK Methods

Once PlayerZero is initialized, you can use a variety of SDK methods to enhance functionality.

### Track Custom Analytics Events

Send additional analytics events to PlayerZero:

`PlayerZero.track("checkout", { item: "chocolate" });`

### Generate a Devtools URL

Generate a link that opens the session directly in PlayerZero devtools:

`PlayerZero.devtoolsUrl().then((url) => { console.log("PlayerZero Devtools URL", url); });`

### Full API Reference

- `PlayerZero.init(projectId: string)`  
  Initialize PlayerZero with your project ID.

- `PlayerZero.isInitialized(): boolean`  
  Returns whether PlayerZero has already been initialized.

- `PlayerZero.identify(userId: string, metadata: Record<string, unknown>)`  
  Identify a user with metadata.

- `PlayerZero.setUserVars(metadata: Record<string, unknown>)`  
  Set additional metadata on the current user without re-identifying.

- `PlayerZero.track(event: string, metadata?: Record<string, unknown>)`  
  Track an event in PlayerZero.

- `PlayerZero.prompt()`  
  Open the Devtools share window.

- `PlayerZero.devtoolsUrl(): Promise<string>`  
  Returns a URL that opens the current session in devtools.

- `PlayerZero.kill()`  
  Permanently shut down PlayerZero on the current page session.

## Building a Custom Devtools Button

The default blue share button is disabled on production environments. To give users a branded way to trigger the devtools popup, you can build your own button using the `playerzero.prompt()` method.

This allows you to integrate a custom trigger (like a button) anywhere in your application UI. The function is available globally when PlayerZero is active on the page.

You can even test this directly in your browser console by running `playerzero.prompt()` on a page where PlayerZero is initialized.

## Resolving Missing Network Calls

### Problem

In rare cases, PlayerZero may fail to capture network traffic when other libraries (e.g., Apollo GraphQL, Sentry, DataDog RUM) override `window.fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`.

### Solution

To address this, embed a small patch script **as the first script tag in your HTML `<head>`** — before any third-party libraries are loaded.

This ensures that PlayerZero wraps `window.fetch` before any other library does, giving it access to monitor requests and errors reliably.

If this problem doesn’t apply to you, you can safely ignore this step.
