description: "Configure thresholds, error patterns, and PII filters for PlayerZero."

## Overview
- **What this section is for**: Fine-tune how PlayerZero interprets slowness and filters sensitive data.
- **Key benefits**:
  - Customize performance thresholds based on your app needs.
  - Catch silent API failures.
  - Add extra protection for sensitive data in transit.
- **Who this is for**: Teams with performance SLAs, compliance requirements, or custom API behaviors.

## Network Performance Threshold

By default, PlayerZero will flag any API response that takes longer than **8000ms** to resolve from the browser’s perspective.

You can customize this threshold to match your app’s performance expectations.  
(Example: lower it to 4000ms for performance-sensitive apps.)
## Special API Error Phrases Sometimes APIs return a `200 OK` but the response still indicates a failure (e.g. `"error": true` in the body).

Add any known error keywords or patterns here so PlayerZero can detect and highlight those sessions too.

Common examples:
- `"internal_error"`
- `"user_not_authorized"`
- `"status": "FAILED"`

Once configured, PlayerZero will monitor for these phrases in the body of your API responses and build error stories accordingly.

## Key Filtering (Beta)

PlayerZero automatically redacts sensitive fields using built-in regex-based filtering.

### Data We Automatically Filter:
- Email addresses
- Social Security Numbers
- Phone numbers
- Full names
- Addresses
- Credit card numbers
- Authorization tokens
- And many more...

### Add Custom Keys

You can also specify **custom JSON keys** (e.g. `password`, `auth_token`) to be redacted **before data leaves the browser**.

This ensures sensitive values never reach PlayerZero’s servers.
