## Overview

PlayerZero gives you powerful controls to fine-tune how your application's network performance, error patterns, and sensitive data are handled. By configuring custom thresholds, special API error phrases, and field-level data filtering, your team can catch silent failures earlier, enforce compliance standards, and adapt monitoring to meet your app’s unique performance needs. These settings help ensure that PlayerZero provides the right insights while protecting sensitive information.

## Network Performance Threshold

By default, PlayerZero will flag any API response that takes longer than **8000ms** to resolve from the browser’s perspective.

You can customize this threshold to match your app’s performance expectations.  
(Example: lower it to 4000ms for performance-sensitive apps.)
## Special API Error Phrases Sometimes APIs return a `200 OK` but the response still indicates a failure (e.g. `"error": true` in the body).

Add any known error keywords or patterns here so PlayerZero can detect and highlight those sessions too.

Common examples:
- `"internal_error"`
- `"user_not_authorized"`
- `"status": "FAILED"`

Once configured, PlayerZero will monitor for these phrases in the body of your API responses and build error stories accordingly.

## Key Filtering (Beta)

PlayerZero automatically redacts sensitive fields using built-in regex-based filtering.

### Data We Automatically Filter:
- Email addresses
- Social Security Numbers
- Phone numbers
- Full names
- Addresses
- Credit card numbers
- Authorization tokens
- And many more...

### Add Custom Keys

You can also specify **custom JSON keys** (e.g. `password`, `auth_token`) to be redacted **before data leaves the browser**.

This ensures sensitive values never reach PlayerZero’s servers.
