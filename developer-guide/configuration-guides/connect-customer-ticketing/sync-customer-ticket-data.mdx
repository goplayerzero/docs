## Overview 

PlayerZero allows you to ingest customer tickets from your existing support platforms. This helps you:

- Correlate external customer complaints with backend errors and user sessions
- Prioritize issues based on real-world impact
- Close the loop between customer support and engineering teams

Once connected, PlayerZero automatically pulls in ticket metadata (like ticket IDs, descriptions, and timestamps) to enrich your incident and defect analysis.

---

## Setup Instructions

The integration process is simple and UI-driven:

1. From the PlayerZero web app, navigate to the **Home** page.
2. Click **Connectors**.
3. Select your ticketing platform (e.g., Zendesk, Jira Service Management, Salesforce Service Cloud).
4. Authorize PlayerZero to access your ticketing system.
5. Enter your domain, workspace, or API key if required.
6. PlayerZero will begin syncing customer tickets for correlation with user sessions, telemetry, and defects.
