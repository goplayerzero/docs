title: "Omitting Files Using .pzignore"
description: "Configure your repository to exclude sensitive or unnecessary files from PlayerZero’s analysis."
---

## Overview 

A `.pzignore` file is placed in the root directory of your repository to exclude specific files or folders from PlayerZero’s code ingestion process. This works similarly to a `.gitignore` file, allowing you to specify patterns of files that PlayerZero should ignore. Since `.pzignore` is derived from `.gitignore`, you don’t need to duplicate exclusions already covered by `.gitignore`.

### Why Use `.pzignore`?

- Security: Prevents analysis of secrets, credentials, and private data.
- Performance: Skips large binaries, build artifacts, and unnecessary generated files.

## How to Implement `.pzignore`

1. **Create the file**  
   In your repository’s root directory, create a new file named `.pzignore`.

2. **Add file patterns**  
   Each line in `.pzignore` represents a pattern for files or directories PlayerZero should skip. Patterns can use wildcards (e.g., `*.pem`) or relative paths (e.g., `dist/`).

3. **Commit the file**  
   Commit `.pzignore` to your repository. PlayerZero will automatically detect and honor these patterns on subsequent ingestions.

## Example: `.pzignore` File

Below is a sample `.pzignore` file that demonstrates common exclusions. Customize and expand this file to meet your specific needs.

```plaintext
# .pzignore

# Security - sensitive files
.env
secrets/
**/config/credentials.yml
private_key.pem
*.pfx
**/auth/tokens.json
```

Using `.pzignore` ensures that only relevant code is analyzed, enhancing security and performance in your development workflow.
