# Private Data Storage

PlayerZero offers the ability to store sensitive data—such as code context and devtools artifacts—in a private S3 bucket owned and managed by your organization. This ensures that all persisted data remains within your infrastructure, giving you full control over access, encryption, and compliance.

> **Note**: This feature is available exclusively on **Enterprise Plans**.

## Why Use Private Storage?

By integrating your own storage layer, you can:
- Maintain ownership of sensitive application data
- Meet regulatory and security requirements (e.g., HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR)
- Apply your own encryption, IAM policies, and retention rules
- Ensure data never leaves your cloud perimeter

PlayerZero will read from and write to this bucket during normal product operation (e.g., sharing devtools data, code snapshots, etc.).

---

## Recommended Setup

We support any S3-compatible storage provider. Most teams choose:

- **Amazon S3**
- **MinIO**, for self-hosted S3 compatibility

While we recommend using AWS's `us-east-1` region (where PlayerZero systems are located), you are free to host your bucket in any region. We will automatically optimize for performance wherever possible.

## 1. Create a Secure S3 Bucket

Provision a bucket using your organization’s usual naming and configuration standards. We recommend the following general guidelines:

- **Access Control**: Keep ACLs disabled; use IAM roles and policies for access.
- **Versioning**: Not required—PlayerZero will recreate missing data if needed.
- **Encryption**: Enable default encryption (server-side encryption with the method of your choice).
- **Object Lock**: Should be disabled to prevent unnecessary performance degradation.

> If you're using a provider other than AWS, ensure your storage solution supports S3-compatible APIs.

## 2. Create a Scoped API Token

In order for PlayerZero to interact with your S3 bucket, you'll need to generate access credentials with scoped permissions.

- **Create a new IAM group** (e.g., `playerzero-storage`)
- **Attach permissions**: Grant full access to the specific S3 bucket
- **Create a new IAM user** (e.g., `playerzero-api`) that belongs to this group
- **Generate access keys** for the user  
  (Be sure to copy both the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key securely; the secret key will not be visible again.)

> Do not grant console access to this user. The keys will only be used for backend programmatic access.

---

## 3. Share Credentials with PlayerZero

Once you’ve created your bucket and API credentials, securely share the following with your PlayerZero account team:

- Bucket name and region
- Access Key ID
- Secret Access Key

PlayerZero will use these credentials exclusively for storage interactions and will not access any other part of your infrastructure.

---

## Alternative: Self-Hosted Storage

If you do not use AWS or prefer to host the storage internally, we recommend using [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) — an open-source S3-compatible object store. This gives you the same private storage model with complete control.
