## Overview 

PlayerZero is designed to help engineering teams uncover, diagnose, and resolve software issues by grounding insights in the one place all technical problems ultimately touch: the codebase.

Our platform connects signals across telemetry, user sessions, support tickets, and repositories to give your team a unified, contextual view of your software systems. But in doing so, we also take a clear position on data privacy and system boundaries.

This page outlines how we think about data access, storage, and protection.

## We Don’t Store Code

When you connect your codebase to PlayerZero, we reference it — but we don’t keep a copy.

Instead, we use commit metadata, file paths, and diff information to correlate events back to specific code changes. This gives you insight without ever persisting the actual contents of your codebase.

## We Mask PII Before It Leaves the Browser

PlayerZero automatically redacts a wide range of sensitive data before it ever reaches our servers, including:

- Emails  
- Usernames and full names  
- Addresses  
- Phone numbers  
- Credit card numbers  
- Tokens and keys

This redaction happens at the edge — in the browser or client — ensuring that sensitive fields are stripped or masked before transmission.

You can also define custom fields to redact based on your application’s structure. If there's something you want masked, we'll help you catch it before it leaves the user’s device.

## Your Storage, If You Prefer

For teams with additional privacy or compliance requirements, we support private object storage via S3-compatible buckets.

This allows you to:
- Store devtools artifacts (like session captures) on infrastructure you own
- Apply your own encryption and access controls
- Retain full ownership of any persisted data

We connect to your storage layer via scoped credentials and use it for temporary reads/writes — nothing is stored by PlayerZero.

---

## You Control What We See

We provide tools to make sure PlayerZero only works with the parts of your system you want it to:

- `.pzignore` allows you to exclude sensitive files or directories from ingestion.
- You can configure custom redaction rules for telemetry and session data.
- We scope access to repositories and integrations using the minimum required permissions.

Everything we ingest is tied back to your code — not abstracted away into a black box. That’s how we keep our insights relevant, and your data footprint small.

---

## Designed for Trust

We don’t treat security as a marketing checkbox — it’s foundational to how we build and operate.

From redaction at the source, to scoped access across integrations, to optional self-hosted storage — our goal is to give you clarity and control, not complexity.

We’ll never store your code.  
We’ll never collect PII we don’t need.  
And we’ll always be transparent about where your data is going and why.
