  ## Prompting Best Practices and Examples

    #### Effective Prompting Strategies
      1. **Focus on User Workflows, Not Single Functions**  
         - *GOOD:* “Show me the login function.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me the complete user‑authentication workflow—including login, session management, password reset, and account‑lockout scenarios.”  

      2. **Think in Test Scenarios, Not Just Code Coverage**  
         - *GOOD:* “Find form‑validation code.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me user‑registration validation covering all rules, error conditions, and edge cases I should test.”  

      3. **Highlight Integration & Dependency Needs**  
         - *GOOD:* “Show me API endpoints.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Map the payment‑processing flow, including all service interactions, external API calls, and failure scenarios to test.”  

      4. **Understand Business Logic for Meaningful Tests**  
         - *GOOD:* “Find calculation functions.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me how shipping costs are calculated, including discounts and international‑shipping edge cases.”  

    #### Unsatisfactory Prompting Examples
      1. **Function‑Level Focus Without Context**  
         - *BAD:* “Show me the validateEmail function.”  
         - **WHY:** Misses broader validation context and integration.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me email validation across registration and profile‑update flows, including all rules and error scenarios.”  

      2. **Generic Testing Requests**  
         - *BAD:* “What should I test?”  
         - **WHY:** Too broad; doesn’t leverage the AI’s understanding.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me the checkout implementation and identify critical test scenarios for payment failures and inventory conflicts.”  

      3. **Tool‑Specific Without Business Context**  
         - *BAD:* “Show me all API endpoints.”  
         - **WHY:** Ignores testing strategy and requirements.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me user‑account‑management APIs and help design tests for creation, updates, and security scenarios.”  

      4. **Missing Error‑Scenario Focus**  
         - *BAD:* “Show me the happy‑path code.”  
         - **WHY:** Overlooks crucial edge cases.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me the order‑processing flow—including error conditions, timeouts, and data‑validation failures—to test.”
