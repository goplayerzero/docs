## Prompting Best Practices and Examples

### Effective Prompting Strategies
      1. **Think in System Flows, Not Individual Files**  
         - *GOOD:* “Find the user authentication service.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me the complete user‑authentication flow from API request through JWT validation, database lookup, and response generation.”  

      2. **Combine Code with Production Behavior**  
         - *GOOD:* “Find the payment processing code.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me the payment‑processing implementation related to errors or performance issues users have experienced during checkout.”  

      3. **Focus on Business Logic and Data Flow**  
         - *GOOD:* “Find database queries for orders.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Trace how order data flows from creation through payment processing, inventory updates, and fulfillment, including all database interactions.”  

      4. **Consider Service Boundaries and Integration**  
         - *GOOD:* “Show me the notification service.”  
         - *BETTER:* “How does the notification service integrate with the user service and email provider? Show me the API contracts, error handling, and retry logic.”  

### Unsatisfactory Prompting Examples
      1. **Single‑File Focus**  
         - *POOR:* “Show me `UserController.java`.”  
         - **WHY:** Misses the broader system context and service interactions.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me how user management works across all services, including authentication, authorization, and user data persistence.”  

      2. **Technology‑Specific Without Context**  
         - *POOR:* “Find all Redis usage.”  
         - **WHY:** Doesn’t explain what you’re trying to understand or accomplish.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me how we use Redis for session management and caching, including any performance patterns or expiration strategies.”  

      3. **Generic Performance Questions**  
         - *POOR:* “Why is the system slow?”  
         - **WHY:** Too vague for the AI to provide targeted assistance.  
         - *BETTER:* “Users are experiencing slow response times on the product‑search API. Show me the search implementation, database queries, and any recent performance traces.”  

      4. **Infrastructure Without Application Context**  
         - *POOR:* “Show me Kubernetes configs.”  
         - **WHY:** Misses the connection between infrastructure and application behavior.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me how the order‑processing service is deployed and configured, and how that relates to the recent timeout errors we’ve been seeing.”
