    - **Data Integration Mapping:** Discover how different systems exchange data and maintain consistency.  

  ## Prompting Best Practices and Examples

    ### Effective Prompting Strategies
      1. **Focus on Data Flows, Not Individual Tables**  
         - *GOOD:* “Show me the user table schema.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Trace how user data flows from registration through profile updates to account deletion, including all transformations and validations.”  

      2. **Connect Business Logic to Data Implementation**  
         - *GOOD:* “Find revenue calculation code.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me how revenue metrics are calculated in the code, including any business rules, discounts, refunds, and how this data is stored and aggregated.”  

      3. **Understand Data Quality Through Code**  
         - *GOOD:* “Show me data validation.”  
         - *BETTER:* “What validation rules and data‑quality checks are implemented for customer data, and how do they ensure data consistency across the system?”  

      4. **Map Data Sources and Destinations**  
         - *GOOD:* “Find database connections.”  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me all the places where user‑behavior data is collected, how it’s processed, and where it’s ultimately stored or exported.”  

    ### Unsatisfactory Prompting Examples
      1. **Schema‑Only Requests**  
         - *POOR:* “Show me the database schema.”  
         - **WHY:** Misses business logic and data‑processing context.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me the customer data model including how it’s validated, processed, and used in business calculations.”  

      2. **Generic Data Requests**  
         - *POOR:* “Find all data tables.”  
         - **WHY:** Too broad and doesn’t specify analytical purpose.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me all data models related to user engagement and how they connect to calculate retention metrics.”  

      3. **Tool‑Specific Without Context**  
         - *POOR:* “Show me SQL queries.”  
         - **WHY:** Doesn’t explain what you’re trying to understand about the data.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me how product‑performance metrics are calculated, including the database queries and business logic involved.”  

      4. **Missing Business Context**  
         - *POOR:* “Find API endpoints.”  
         - **WHY:** Doesn’t connect to data‑analysis needs.  
         - *BETTER:* “Show me API endpoints that expose customer data and how they transform or filter information for different use cases.”
