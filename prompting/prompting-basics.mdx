## PlayerZero prompting basics
- **Be specific and detailed** – The more context you provide, the better the AI can understand and respond. Include relevant details, links, or examples when possible.
- **Start with a clear “kickoff” question** – Use your first question to set the direction. This helps the AI frame the context window and stay focused on your objective.
- **Embrace follow-ups as part of the process** – You don’t need to get everything perfect upfront. Think of prompting as a back-and-forth—refine and redirect as needed.
- **Assign tasks like you would with a teammate**
 – Approach PlayerZero as if you’re delegating a job. Be clear about what you want done, and give it the same guidance you’d give a human peer.
- **Use complete thoughts and full sentences** – This helps reduce ambiguity and ensures your intent is understood the first time.
- **Have a goal before you start** – Whether you’re trying to debug an issue, summarize internal context, or explore part of the codebase—know what you’re aiming to accomplish so the AI can guide you there faster.

## Great prompts ask for clear outputs by linking specific concepts together
**Sample Prompts:**
- "Tell me different actions users can take when managing invoices and explain how different user roles change what they’re allowed to do."
- "I'm getting this error **[Paste in Error]**. Show me functions that are linked to this error and summarize the impact this has on the user."
