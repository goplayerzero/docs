## PlayerZero AI Chat: Tier 1 Support Guide

As a Tier 1 Support specialist, PlayerZero AI Chat transforms how you diagnose user issues, find solutions, and provide accurate assistance.

- **Instant Issue Diagnosis:** Quickly correlate user descriptions with real system behavior.  
- **Cross‑System Problem Solving:** Connect user reports to code implementations, recent changes, and related historical issues.  
- **Accurate Technical Translation:** Bridge the gap between user language (“the button doesn’t work”) and technical reality (API errors, validation failures).  
- **Impact Assessment:** Determine whether an issue is isolated or indicative of a broader problem.  
- **Intelligent Escalation:** Provide engineering with precise context, relevant code sections, and reproduction steps.  

## Prompting Best Practices and Examples

### Effective Prompting Strategies  
1. **Start with User Language, Not Technical Terms**  
   - *GOOD:* “Find issues with login problems.”  
   - *BETTER:* “A user says they can’t log in and keep getting an error message. Show me what might be causing login failures and similar recent reports.”  

2. **Focus on User Impact and Business Context**  
   - *GOOD:* “Show me payment processing code.”  
   - *BETTER:* “Multiple users report their credit‑card payments are being declined. What could cause this and how do we fix it?”  

3. **Ask for Solutions, Not Just Explanations**  
   - *GOOD:* “Why is the checkout page slow?”  
   - *BETTER:* “Users complain about slow checkout. Show me causes of delay and any temporary work‑arounds I can offer.”  

4. **Include Timeline and Pattern Context**  
   - *GOOD:* “Find email‑delivery issues.”  
   - *BETTER:* “Since yesterday, users haven’t received password‑reset emails. Show me the email system, recent changes, and similar past issues.”  

### Unsatisfactory Prompting Examples  
1. **Single‑Issue Focus Without Context**  
   - *POOR:* “User can’t access dashboard.”  
   - **WHY:** Too little context for pattern recognition or solution finding.  
   - *BETTER:* “A user can’t access their dashboard after login. Show me dashboard‑access issues and the questions I should ask them.”  

2. **Vague Problem Descriptions**  
   - *POOR:* “Something is broken.”  
   - **WHY:** Not enough information for targeted help.  
   - *BETTER:* “Users get an error when updating profiles. Show me profile‑update issues and what these errors might mean.”  

3. **Looking for Code Instead of Solutions**  
   - *POOR:* “Show me the user‑registration code.”  
   - **WHY:** Focuses on details without solving the user’s problem.  
   - *BETTER:* “Users can’t complete registration—form won’t submit. Show me registration issues and how to help them sign up.”
