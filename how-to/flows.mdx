## Set Up Your First Flow

Flows represent a space to represent the things you care about most in your application. 

Flows is a powerful feature that gives you the ability to declaratively represent the critical pathways in your application that you wish to track and automatically find any errors that users run into along the way. Setting up a Flow is simple and takes only a few minutes. Here's a quick guide on how to configure Flows in PlayerZero.

## Creating a Flow

First, navigate to Flows on the left side of your screen once you’re in the PlayerZero application. Next, click “Add Flow” – upon doing so, you’ll have the option to string together events that represent the path you want to monitor.

By default, the options you’ll see here will correspond to events within your own application. Select each step of the flow that you’d like to track. If you do not see any options, click “Add a step” at the top right of the page.

**Each step in a flow is a key checkpoint.**

Try not to overdefine the flow. Each step in the flow is meant to represent a key moment in the journey you’re trying to represent. Therefore, the events that make up a flow do not need to be verbose. For example, if I’m building a flow for an e-commerce site to monitor a user’s ability to check out, I’d define the flow with two events: “Add to Cart” and then “Checkout”. Note in this case, we did not have to define every intermediate step that could take place, just the important milestones in the user journey.
