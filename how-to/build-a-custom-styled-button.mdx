The blue button to share your devtools is great for internal use, but many teams
don't want to expose an off-brand button on their production site. In fact, for
all environments except localhost, the button is actually turned off by default!

We're left with two options here.

- Use the CMD / Ctrl + K shortcut to trigger the share workflow.
- **Or build a button into a dedicated place in your product so that users can
  share their devtools without a shortcut**

### tldr;

The PlayerZero snippet exposes a function called `prompt()` on its window object
to trigger this flow. You can call it whenever you'd like to make the popup come
up.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript HTML Snippet or Segment
playerzero.prompt();
```

```javascript SDK
import PlayerZero from "@playerzero/sdk-web";

PlayerZero.prompt();
```

</CodeGroup>

In fact you could test this by running `playerzero.prompt()` in the console of
your real devtools of an application that has PlayerZero enabled. Depending on
your application's architecture, you can call this function `onClick` to fit
into the share workflow.
