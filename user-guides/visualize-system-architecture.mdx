title: "Visualize System Architecture"
description: "Use PlayerZero to generate live, accurate diagrams of your services, APIs, and data flows for faster planning, onboarding, and migrations."

Most teams struggle to keep an accurate picture of their architecture — especially during major changes like framework migrations, system integrations, or audits. PlayerZero automatically builds **live, up-to-date system visuals** directly from your codebase and infrastructure, helping your team plan and execute changes with confidence.

## Example Prompts to Try

You can use prompts like these to quickly uncover key insights about your systems and make faster, more confident decisions during planning or troubleshooting:

- “Generate a system diagram showing all services and APIs impacted by our `.NET → .NET Core` migration.”  
- “Highlight the dependencies for our `Payment Gateway` service and show any recent changes that could affect performance.”  
- “Create a living diagram of all microservices that touch the `Customer Profile` data model.”  
- “Which APIs rely on our `legacy-auth` module, and what downstream systems are affected if we refactor it?”  
- “Show me how `OrderService` connects across frontend, backend, and data layers, including recent code changes.”

## Additional Tips

PlayerZero helps your team **quickly visualize and understand your systems**, so you can make informed decisions about migrations, upgrades, and ongoing development. When using PlayerZero to map your architecture or document your codebase:

- **Start with your biggest challenge** — for example, a migration, a major integration, or a system audit.  
- **See your architecture live** — PlayerZero connects directly to your repositories to build accurate, up-to-date diagrams and data flows.  
- **Explore and refine** — ask follow-up questions like:  
  - “Which services are most at risk if we refactor this API?”  
  - “Who owns each of these modules today?”  
- **Turn insight into action** — use the outputs to accelerate planning, reduce surprises during development, and share clear documentation across teams.

## Adapting PlayerZero to Your Environment

PlayerZero can be tailored to your exact needs:

- Focus on **your systems, services, or frameworks** (e.g., .NET → .NET Core, Angular → React, or database migrations).  
- Visualize how **your real codebase and dependencies** connect, including APIs, services, and data pipelines.  
- **Export diagrams and documentation** to share with your engineering, QA, and leadership teams — making onboarding, planning, and cross-team collaboration easier.
