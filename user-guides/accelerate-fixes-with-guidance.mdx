## Example Prompts to Try

- “Suggest a fix for this API timeout based on how similar incidents were resolved.”  
- “Show code patterns used to fix validation errors in our `UserController` module.”  
- “Which past fixes can guide resolving this recurring checkout bug?”  
- “Generate a code suggestion that matches our existing error handling standards.”  

## Additional Tips

PlayerZero speeds up fixes by making your **team’s past solutions reusable**:  

- **Start by asking for historical context** (“How was this issue fixed before?”).  
- **Ask for aligned code suggestions** so fixes match team conventions.  
- **Follow up with pattern validation** (“Does this fix align with our error-handling style?”).
