title: "Trace Dependencies and Integration Risks"
description: "Use PlayerZero to highlight service dependencies, API contracts, and risk points for testing."
---

Integration failures are a common source of production issues. PlayerZero helps teams **identify service and data dependencies** and **prioritize testing** for riskier areas.

---

## Example Prompts to Try

- “Show all downstream systems impacted by changes to `InventoryService`.”  
- “Highlight the API contracts most likely to fail during the `Payments` upgrade.”  
- “List integration points that need regression testing for this release.”  

## Additional Tips

PlayerZero reduces **integration-related risk** by:  
- **Mapping dependencies and contracts** clearly.  
- **Highlighting risk-prone points** for prioritization.  
- **Guiding regression testing** with concrete data.
