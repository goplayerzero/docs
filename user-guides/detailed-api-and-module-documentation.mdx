description: "Use PlayerZero to automatically create, update, and share API and module documentation that stays accurate as your code evolves."
---

Outdated or missing documentation makes it hard for teams to understand APIs and modules, leading to delays and errors. PlayerZero generates accurate, always-current documentation from your codebase, complete with examples, parameters, and integration details.

---

## Example Prompts to Try

You can use prompts like these to quickly generate accurate, actionable documentation and accelerate development:

- “Generate API documentation for `BillingService` including all endpoints, parameters, and example calls.”  
- “Show how `UserController` methods are used across services, with code examples.”  
- “List all modules calling the `Invoice API`, including data contracts and authentication patterns.”  
- “Summarize recent changes to the `ProductCatalog` API and update its documentation.”  
- “Create a shareable doc for our `Analytics Module` with example inputs, outputs, and usage scenarios.”

## Additional Tips

PlayerZero helps your team **stay aligned and productive** by ensuring documentation always reflects the current state of your systems. When creating API and module docs:

- **Focus on high-impact areas** — APIs and modules used by multiple teams or customer-facing features.  
- **Include real examples** — PlayerZero can pull request/response samples directly from your code and logs.  
- **Dig deeper** — follow up with prompts for visualizations, dependencies, and recent changes.  
- **Make it accessible** — export the documentation for onboarding, audits, or developer guides.

## Adapting PlayerZero to Your Environment

PlayerZero can tailor documentation to your needs:

- Document **internal-only APIs, public-facing services, or shared modules**.  
- Enrich docs with **code samples, sample calls, and dependency graphs** to make them more useful.  
- **Export or integrate** with your existing knowledge base so your team always has the latest version.
