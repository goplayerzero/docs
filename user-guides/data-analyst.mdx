## Prompting Best Practices and Examples

### Effective Prompting Strategies

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Focus on Data Flows, Not Individual Tables">
- *GOOD:* “Show me the user table schema.”  
- *BETTER:* “Trace how user data flows from registration through profile updates to account deletion, including all transformations and validations.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Connect Business Logic to Data Implementation">
- *GOOD:* “Find revenue calculation code.”  
- *BETTER:* “Show me how revenue metrics are calculated in the code, including any business rules, discounts, refunds, and how this data is stored and aggregated.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Understand Data Quality Through Code">
- *GOOD:* “Show me data validation.”  
- *BETTER:* “What validation rules and data‑quality checks are implemented for customer data, and how do they ensure data consistency across the system?”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Map Data Sources and Destinations">

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Unsatisfactory Prompting Examples

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Schema‑Only Requests">
- *POOR:* “Show me the database schema.”  
- **WHY:** Misses business logic and data‑processing context.  
- *BETTER:* “Show me the customer data model including how it’s validated, processed, and used in business calculations.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Generic Data Requests">
- *POOR:* “Find all data tables.”  
- **WHY:** Too broad and doesn’t specify analytical purpose.  
- *BETTER:* “Show me all data models related to user engagement and how they connect to calculate retention metrics.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool‑Specific Without Context">
- *POOR:* “Show me SQL queries.”  
- **WHY:** Doesn’t explain what you’re trying to understand about the data.  
- *BETTER:* “Show me how product‑performance metrics are calculated, including the database queries and business logic involved.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing Business Context">
- *POOR:* “Find API endpoints.”  
- **WHY:** Doesn’t connect to data‑analysis needs.  
- *BETTER:* “Show me API endpoints that expose customer data and how they transform or filter information for different use cases.”  
</Accordion>
