## PlayerZero AI Chat: Frontend Developer Guide

As a frontend developer, PlayerZero AI Chat transforms how you interact with codebases by providing intelligent, context‑aware assistance that understands both your code structure and user‑experience challenges.

- **Semantic Code Understanding:** Find React components, styling patterns, and UI logic based on natural‑language descriptions rather than exact keyword matches.  
- **Cross‑Repository Intelligence:** Navigate complex frontend architectures spanning multiple repositories, packages, and micro‑services.  
- **Component Discovery:** Locate reusable UI components, design‑system elements, and styling patterns across your entire codebase.  
- **Integration Insights:** Understand how frontend components interact with APIs, state management, and backend services.  

## Prompting Best Practices and Examples

### Effective Prompting Strategies

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Use Natural‑Language Descriptions">
- *GOOD:* “Find the component that handles user authentication and shows loading states.”  
- *BETTER:* “Show me how the login form manages loading states and error messages during authentication.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Provide Context About Your Goal">
- *GOOD:* “Find the responsive navigation component.”  
- *BETTER:* “I need to add a mobile‑menu toggle to the main navigation. Show me the current responsive navigation implementation and recent changes.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Combine Code Structure with User Experience">
- *GOOD:* “Find components that handle form validation.”  
- *BETTER:* “Show me how we handle form‑validation errors in the user‑registration flow, including error‑messaging and accessibility features.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ask for Specific Implementation Details">
- *GOOD:* “How does the dashboard component work?”  
- *BETTER:* “Walk me through the dashboard component’s state management, API calls, and how it handles loading and error states.”  
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Unsatisfactory Prompting Examples

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Overly Generic Requests">
- *POOR:* “Show me all components.”  
- **WHY:** Too broad, no clear objective.  
- *BETTER:* “Show me all form components that handle user‑input validation.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keyword‑Only Searches">
- *POOR:* “button click handler”  
- **WHY:** Misses the semantic‑understanding capabilities.  
- *BETTER:* “Show me how we handle button interactions and state changes in the product‑selection flow.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Single‑Tool Thinking">
- *POOR:* “Search for ‘useState’ in the codebase.”  
- **WHY:** Doesn’t leverage the AI’s understanding of context and relationships.  
- *BETTER:* “Show me how we manage component state in the shopping cart, including local state and any global state management.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vague Problem Descriptions">
- *BAD:* “Something is broken.”  
- **WHY:** Not enough context for the AI to help effectively.  
- *BETTER:* “Users report that the checkout button doesn’t respond on mobile devices. Show me that component and recent changes to the checkout flow.”  
</Accordion>
