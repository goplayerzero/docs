Environment setup delays slow teams down. PlayerZero helps new hires and contributors **find integration points, dependencies, and examples** so they can get productive quickly.

---

## Example Prompts to Try

- “List all dependencies for the `CheckoutService` and how to configure them locally.”  
- “Show example implementations for integrating with the `Payments API`.”  
- “Identify prerequisites for building and testing the `Notifications` module.”  

## Additional Tips

PlayerZero removes friction in **onboarding environments**:  
- **Ask for all dependencies up front** for fewer surprises.  
- **Pull real examples** from the codebase to speed implementation.  
- **Export setup guides** to make this repeatable.
