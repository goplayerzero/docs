## PlayerZero AI Chat: Business Analyst / Solution Architect Guide

As a Business Analyst or Solution Architect, PlayerZero AI Chat helps you turn “how the system really works” into clear, traceable artifacts.

- **Access Living Documentation & Architecture Maps:** Generate current-state maps of services, data models, APIs, and dependencies from the code and runtime behavior.  
- **Connect Business Rules to Code:** Trace policies, pricing rules, SLAs, and workflows directly to the functions, services, and jobs that implement them.  
- **Shorten Learning Curves:** Bootstrap domain knowledge, uncover hidden edge cases, and surface decision context so you can onboard quickly and design solutions with confidence.  

## Prompting Best Practices and Examples

### Effective Prompting Strategies

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Ask for End-to-End Flows, Not Isolated Components">
- *GOOD:* “Show me the checkout service.”  
- *BETTER:* “Map the end-to-end checkout flow—from cart submission to payment capture, fulfillment, and post-purchase notifications—including external services and failure paths.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tie Business Concepts to Concrete Implementations">
- *GOOD:* “Where is discounting handled?”  
- *BETTER:* “Show all discount business rules (codes, stacking limits, eligibility) and trace each rule to the exact modules, jobs, and API endpoints that implement them.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Request Artifacts You Can Share (Diagrams, Tables, Traceability)">
- *GOOD:* “Explain the subscription lifecycle.”  
- *BETTER:* “Produce a sequence diagram of the subscription lifecycle (create, upgrade/downgrade, proration, renewal, cancel). Include the services, events, and data stores involved, and list the key business rules referenced.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Include Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Constraints">
- *GOOD:* “Where is rate limiting implemented?”  
- *BETTER:* “Show how we enforce SLAs (rate limits, timeouts, retries) for the public API, the configuration points, and where SLOs are monitored and alerted.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Add Timeline and Change Context">
- *GOOD:* “How did billing change?”  
- *BETTER:* “List billing-rule changes in the last 90 days, the PRs involved, impacted services, and any migrations or feature flags tied to the rollout.”  
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Unsatisfactory Prompting Examples

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Vague Business-Only Requests">
- *POOR:* “How does pricing work?”  
- **WHY:** Too broad; lacks system scope and artifacts.  
- *BETTER:* “List pricing strategies (tiered, usage-based, discounts) and map each to the code paths and data models that implement them, with example inputs/outputs.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool-Specific Without Goal">
- *POOR:* “Show all APIs.”  
- **WHY:** Lacks purpose; yields unprioritized lists.  
- *BETTER:* “Show APIs used in the customer-onboarding journey and how they enforce KYC/verification requirements.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Component-Level Focus Without Integration">
- *POOR:* “Open the payment controller.”  
- **WHY:** Misses orchestration, retries, and dependencies.  
- *BETTER:* “Map the payment orchestration across services, queues, and third-party processors, including error handling, idempotency, and reconciliation jobs.”  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Solution-First Without Constraints">
- *POOR:* “We should add a cache—where?”  
- **WHY:** Ignores bottlenecks and correctness requirements.  
- *BETTER:* “Identify read-heavy endpoints with p95>400ms and propose safe caching layers with invalidation rules and consistency trade-offs.”  
</Accordion>
