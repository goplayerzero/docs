New engineers can take weeks to learn a complex system. PlayerZero lets them **explore architecture interactively**, connecting services, integrations, and logic so they ramp up faster.

---

## Example Prompts to Try

- ‚ÄúMap out all services connected to `OrderService` with data flows.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúExplain how the frontend communicates with the `Payments API` and show the related code.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúShow me the architecture diagram for all services handling authentication.‚Äù  

## Additional Tips

PlayerZero makes **ramping up on complex systems** much faster:  
- **Start with a single service or flow** to avoid overload.  
- **Use follow-up prompts** to dig into specific code paths.  
- **Export diagrams** for onboarding materials.
