PlayerZero integrates with your existing stack through OAuth-based connections. Once connected, AI agents can read data from your tools, take actions on your behalf, and provide context-aware assistance.

## What Integrations Enable

- **Read context** - AI agents access tickets, issues, documentation, and customer data when investigating problems
- **Take actions** - Create issues, post comments, update statuses, and escalate findings to the right teams
- **Cross-reference** - Search related records across tools to identify patterns and known issues
