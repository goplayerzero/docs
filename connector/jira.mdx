description: "Connect Jira to PlayerZero for AI-assisted issue tracking and project management."
---

Jira is a tool used by agile teams to plan, track, and release software.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Read issues and comments** - Access ticket details, descriptions, attachments, and comment threads for debugging context
- **Create and update issues** - Generate Jira tickets from debug sessions with proper formatting and fields
- **Add comments** - Post structured comments with code references, stack traces, and root cause analysis
- **Navigate projects** - Understand your Jira project structure, issue types, and custom fields

## Use Cases

- **Automated triage** - AI agents analyze incoming bugs and suggest components, priority, or sprint placement
- **Debug-to-ticket workflow** - Convert investigation findings into properly formatted Jira issues
- **Cross-reference analysis** - When debugging, agents search related Jira tickets for historical context and known issues

## Scopes & Permissions

<Info>
PlayerZero requests only the permissions needed for AI agents to assist with debugging and issue management. We follow the principle of least privilege—each permission directly enables a specific capability.
</Info>

| Scope | Why It's Needed |
|-------|-----------------|
| `read:jira-work` | **Context gathering** — Allows AI agents to read issue details, sprint context, and project structure when investigating bugs or cross-referencing related tickets |
| `write:jira-work` | **Issue management** — Enables agents to create issues from debug sessions, post comments with findings, and update ticket fields when you ask them to triage or document work |
| `read:jira-user` | **Team awareness** — Provides access to user profiles so agents can suggest appropriate assignees and understand who reported or owns issues |
| `manage:jira-webhook` | **Real-time sync** — Allows PlayerZero to receive instant notifications when issues change, enabling agents to respond to updates without polling |
| `offline_access` | **Persistent connection** — Maintains the integration without requiring you to re-authenticate, ensuring agents can access Jira context whenever needed |
