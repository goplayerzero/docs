Confluence is a team workspace where knowledge and collaboration meet.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Search documentation** - Find relevant docs, runbooks, and architecture decisions during debugging
- **Read page content** - Access full page content including embedded diagrams and attachments
- **Reference docs in responses** - Link to relevant Confluence pages when explaining system behavior
- **Navigate spaces** - Understand your documentation structure and find related content

## Use Cases

- **Context-aware debugging** - AI agents pull in relevant architecture docs and runbooks when investigating issues
- **Knowledge discovery** - Find existing documentation about error handling, system design, or operational procedures
- **Onboarding support** - New team members get pointed to relevant docs when asking questions about the codebase
