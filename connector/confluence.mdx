description: "Connect Confluence to PlayerZero for AI-assisted documentation access."
---

Confluence is a team workspace where knowledge and collaboration meet.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Search documentation** - Find relevant docs, runbooks, and architecture decisions during debugging
- **Read page content** - Access full page content including embedded diagrams and attachments
- **Reference docs in responses** - Link to relevant Confluence pages when explaining system behavior
- **Navigate spaces** - Understand your documentation structure and find related content

## Use Cases

- **Context-aware debugging** - AI agents pull in relevant architecture docs and runbooks when investigating issues
- **Knowledge discovery** - Find existing documentation about error handling, system design, or operational procedures
- **Onboarding support** - New team members get pointed to relevant docs when asking questions about the codebase

## Scopes & Permissions

<Info>
PlayerZero requests only the permissions needed for AI agents to access and reference your documentation. We follow the principle of least privilege—each permission directly enables a specific capability.

### Read Access

| Scope | Why It's Needed |
|-------|-----------------|
| `read:page:confluence` | **Documentation search** — Allows agents to find and read relevant docs, runbooks, and architecture decisions when investigating issues |
| `read:space:confluence` | **Navigation** — Enables agents to understand your documentation structure and locate content within the right spaces |
| `read:content:confluence` | **Full content access** — Provides access to all content types (pages, blog posts, attachments) so agents can reference complete documentation |
| `read:confluence-user` | **Author context** — Allows agents to identify document authors when you need to know who wrote specific documentation |
| `read:group:confluence` | **Access awareness** — Helps agents understand team structure and content ownership within your Confluence workspace |

### Write Access

| Scope | Why It's Needed |
|-------|-----------------|
| `write:page:confluence` | **Documentation creation** — Enables agents to create new pages when you ask them to document findings or generate runbooks from debug sessions |
| `delete:page:confluence` | **Content management** — Allows agents to remove outdated documentation when you explicitly request cleanup |
| `write:content:confluence` | **Content updates** — Enables agents to update existing documentation with new information when you ask them to maintain docs |
| `write:content.property:confluence` | **Metadata management** — Allows agents to set content properties like labels or status when organizing documentation |

### Connection

| Scope | Why It's Needed |
|-------|-----------------|
| `offline_access` | **Persistent connection** — Maintains the integration without requiring you to re-authenticate, ensuring agents can access Confluence whenever needed |

## Setup

<Note>
Setup starts in PlayerZero—no pre-configuration in Confluence is required.
</Note>

1. In PlayerZero, navigate to **Organization Settings → Integrations**
2. Find **Confluence** and click **Connect**
3. You'll be redirected to Atlassian to log in and authorize PlayerZero
4. After authorization, select which PlayerZero projects should have access to this integration
