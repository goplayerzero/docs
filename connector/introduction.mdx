PlayerZero uses [connectors](/connector/introduction) to quickly connect and build visiblity to the
different parts of your engineering, product, and business.
Most of these connectors are OAuth and API based and therefore require minimal setup.

Our API connectors fall into a few categories:
1. Code & Git Connectors
2. Project Management Systems (Internal Tickets)
3. Customer (External) Ticketing Systems
4. Analytics (event based analytics)
5. Error Monitoring & Telemetry
