description: "Connect Azure DevOps to PlayerZero for AI-assisted work item management."
---

Azure DevOps provides development services for teams to plan work, collaborate on code, and build applications.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Read work items** - Access bugs, tasks, user stories, and their full history for debugging context
- **Create and update work items** - Generate work items from debug sessions with proper fields and relationships
- **Add comments** - Post discussion comments with investigation findings and code references
- **Navigate boards** - Understand your team's area paths, iterations, and work item types

## Use Cases

- **Automated triage** - AI agents analyze incoming bugs and suggest area paths, priority, or iteration placement
- **Debug-to-work-item workflow** - Convert investigation findings into properly structured Azure DevOps work items
- **Sprint context** - When debugging, agents understand current sprint work and related items

## Scopes & Permissions

<Info>
PlayerZero requests only the permissions needed for AI agents to assist with work item management. We follow the principle of least privilege—each permission directly enables a specific capability.
</Info>

| Scope | Why It's Needed |
|-------|-----------------|
| `vso.work_full` | **Work item management** — Allows agents to read work items for context during debugging, create new items from debug sessions, post comments with findings, and update fields when you ask them to triage or document work |
| `vso.project` | **Project navigation** — Enables agents to understand your project structure, area paths, and iterations so they can create work items in the right location and suggest appropriate sprint placement |
| `vso.identity` | **Team awareness** — Provides access to user and group identities so agents can suggest appropriate assignees and understand team membership when routing issues |

## Setup

<Note>
Setup starts in PlayerZero—no pre-configuration in Azure DevOps is required.
</Note>

### Step 1: Start the Connection

1. In PlayerZero, navigate to **Organization Settings → Integrations**
2. Find **Azure DevOps** in the available integrations list
3. Click the **+** button to open the connection dialog

### Step 2: Select PlayerZero Projects

Before connecting to Azure DevOps, you'll choose which PlayerZero projects can use this integration:

- **All Projects** — Every project in your organization will have access to this Azure DevOps connection. New projects added later will automatically have access.
- **Custom Selection** — Only the specific projects you check will have access. Use this if you have multiple teams or want to limit which projects can create or read Azure DevOps work items.

<Tip>
You can change this selection at any time after setup from the integration detail page.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Authorize with Azure DevOps

1. Click **Connect Azure DevOps** to start the OAuth flow
2. You'll be redirected to Microsoft to sign in (if not already signed in)
3. Review the permissions PlayerZero is requesting and click **Accept**
4. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to PlayerZero

### Step 4: Configure Workflows (Optional)

Once connected, you can configure automated workflows for each enabled project:

- **Ticket routing** — Automatically create work items from Player sessions
- **Filters** — Specify which issues should trigger the integration based on title, description, or tags

### Managing the Integration

After setup, you can:
- **Edit project access** — Add or remove projects that can use this integration
- **Disable/enable** — Temporarily pause the integration without disconnecting
- **Disconnect** — Remove the integration entirely (requires re-authorization to reconnect)
