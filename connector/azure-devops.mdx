Azure DevOps provides development services for teams to plan work, collaborate on code, and build applications.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Read work items** - Access bugs, tasks, user stories, and their full history for debugging context
- **Create and update work items** - Generate work items from debug sessions with proper fields and relationships
- **Add comments** - Post discussion comments with investigation findings and code references
- **Navigate boards** - Understand your team's area paths, iterations, and work item types

## Use Cases

- **Automated triage** - AI agents analyze incoming bugs and suggest area paths, priority, or iteration placement
- **Debug-to-work-item workflow** - Convert investigation findings into properly structured Azure DevOps work items
- **Sprint context** - When debugging, agents understand current sprint work and related items
