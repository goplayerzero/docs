Zendesk is a customer service platform designed to improve customer relationships.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Read tickets and comments** - Access full ticket history, customer messages, and agent responses for context
- **Create and update tickets** - Generate support tickets from debug sessions or update existing ones with findings
- **Add internal notes** - Post investigation results and technical details as internal comments
- **Search tickets** - Find related tickets and known issues when investigating problems

## Use Cases

- **Support triage** - AI agents analyze incoming tickets and suggest priority, tags, or assignment based on code analysis
- **Debug-to-ticket workflow** - Convert investigation findings into detailed Zendesk tickets for customer communication
- **Known issue detection** - When investigating, agents search for similar past tickets to identify patterns

## Scopes & Permissions

<Info>
PlayerZero requests only the permissions needed for AI agents to assist with support workflows. We follow the principle of least privilege—each permission directly enables a specific capability.
