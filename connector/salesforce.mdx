---

Salesforce is a cloud-based CRM platform that helps manage customer relationships and business processes.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Read customer data** - Access account, contact, and case information for customer context during debugging
- **Create and update cases** - Generate support cases from debug sessions or update existing ones
- **Add case comments** - Post investigation findings and technical details to customer cases
- **Search records** - Find related accounts, opportunities, or cases when investigating customer-reported issues

## Use Cases

- **Customer context** - When debugging a user-reported issue, agents pull in relevant Salesforce account and case history
- **Support escalation** - Convert technical findings into well-documented Salesforce cases for support teams
- **Account intelligence** - Understand customer tier, history, and open issues when prioritizing bugs

## Scopes & Permissions

<Info>
PlayerZero requests only the permissions needed for AI agents to assist with customer context and case management. We follow the principle of least privilege—each permission directly enables a specific capability.

|-------|-----------------|
| `api` | **Core access** — Required for all Salesforce API calls, enabling agents to read cases, accounts, and contacts when investigating customer-reported issues |
| `id` | **User identification** — Allows agents to identify the connected user and properly attribute actions taken on your behalf |
| `profile` | **User context** — Provides access to your user profile so agents understand your role and permissions within Salesforce |
| `email` | **Contact matching** — Enables agents to correlate Salesforce contacts with users in your application when investigating issues |
| `address` | **Account context** — Allows agents to understand customer location context when relevant to support cases |
| `phone` | **Contact details** — Provides complete contact information when agents need to reference customer data during debugging |
