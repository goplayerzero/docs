Linear is a project management and issue tracking tool designed for software teams.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Read issues and comments** - Access issue details, descriptions, and conversation history for context during debugging
- **Create and update issues** - Automatically create issues from debug sessions or update existing ones with findings
- **Add comments** - Post investigation results, root cause analysis, or reproduction steps directly to issues
- **Access project context** - Understand team structure, labels, and workflows to provide relevant assistance

## Use Cases

- **Automated triage** - AI agents analyze incoming issues and suggest priority, labels, or assignees based on code analysis
- **Debug-to-ticket workflow** - Convert debug findings into well-documented Linear issues with one click
- **Context-aware support** - When investigating issues, agents pull in related Linear tickets for full context
