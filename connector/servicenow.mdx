---

ServiceNow provides cloud computing solutions to streamline enterprise IT operations.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Read incidents and requests** - Access incident details, change requests, and service catalog items for context
- **Create and update records** - Generate incidents from debug sessions or update existing ones with findings
- **Add work notes** - Post investigation results and technical details to incident records
- **Navigate CMDB** - Understand configuration items and service relationships when debugging

## Use Cases

- **Incident triage** - AI agents analyze incoming incidents and suggest category, priority, or assignment group
- **Debug-to-incident workflow** - Convert investigation findings into properly categorized ServiceNow incidents
- **Change correlation** - When debugging, agents identify recent changes that may have caused the issue

## Scopes & Permissions

<Info>
PlayerZero requests only the permissions needed for AI agents to assist with IT service management. We follow the principle of least privilege—each permission directly enables a specific capability.
</Info>

PlayerZero requests access to ServiceNow via OAuth. The specific permissions depend on your ServiceNow instance configuration and the tables/applications you grant access to.

### Why We Need Each Access Level

| Access | Why It's Needed |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Incident table (read/write)** | **Issue management** — Allows agents to read incident details for context during debugging, and create or update incidents when you ask them to document findings or escalate issues |
| **Change request table (read)** | **Change correlation** — Enables agents to identify recent changes that may have caused an issue, providing crucial context during root cause analysis |
| **CMDB (read)** | **Infrastructure context** — Provides access to configuration items and service relationships, helping agents understand how components connect when debugging |
| **User table (read)** | **Team awareness** — Allows agents to identify incident owners, assignment groups, and suggest appropriate escalation paths |

Setup starts in PlayerZero—no pre-configuration in ServiceNow is required.
