ServiceNow provides cloud computing solutions to streamline enterprise IT operations.

## What You Can Do

Once connected, PlayerZero AI agents can:

- **Read incidents and requests** - Access incident details, change requests, and service catalog items for context
- **Create and update records** - Generate incidents from debug sessions or update existing ones with findings
- **Add work notes** - Post investigation results and technical details to incident records
- **Navigate CMDB** - Understand configuration items and service relationships when debugging

## Use Cases

- **Incident triage** - AI agents analyze incoming incidents and suggest category, priority, or assignment group
- **Debug-to-incident workflow** - Convert investigation findings into properly categorized ServiceNow incidents
- **Change correlation** - When debugging, agents identify recent changes that may have caused the issue

Typical access includes:
- **Incident table** - Read and write incidents
