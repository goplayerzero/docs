## What You Can Do:
- Span large codebases with multiple repositories with a single question
- Generate diagrams, surface system’s behavior, history, and architecture.
- Deflect product or code questions with “living documentation” that updates as your code and processes evolve.
- Effortlessly onboard new teammates with curated, accurate context.
