## **Overview**

PlayerZero connects your codebase with user sessions, error logs, and runtime traces, allowing you to explore implementation details, dependencies, and historical changes in seconds. Ask natural-language questions to uncover where code lives, how it works, and why it was built that way‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre a developer, support engineer, or product manager.

---

## **Prerequisites**

### Source Control Management (Codebase)

**Your codebase is connected to PlayerZero**  
This enables PlayerZero to map runtime errors, traces, and sessions back to the exact lines of code in your repository.  

*If you haven‚Äôt done this yet, see the [SCM Setup Guide].*

---

## **Process**

### 1. **Initiate the AI chat session with an initial question**  
From the input field on the homepage, you can ask a question directly to PlayerZero.  

- *Example*: ‚ÄúWhere is the main implementation of our notification service?‚Äù

### 2. **Guide the Investigation with follow-up questions**  
PlayerZero provides targeted explanations and suggestions based on your focus, drawing from both codebase knowledge and user session data.

- *Example*: ‚ÄúShow me how errors are handled in the notification service.‚Äù

#### **Role-Focused Scenarios**

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="For Developers">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - Where is the main implementation of [specific function/service]?  
    - Show me all the places where [method/class] is being used  
    - What changed in the [specific file/service] in recent PRs?  
    - How does our authentication flow work across services?  
    - Who recently modified [specific component] and why?  
    - How do we handle errors in [specific flow]?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For Support">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - What happens when a user clicks [specific button/action]?  
    - Where are errors logged for [specific feature]?  
    - What are the possible error states for [specific flow]?  
    - How does the system validate [specific type of input]?  
    - What permissions are required for [specific action]?  
    - Where can I find logs related to [specific user action]?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="For Product">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - What features are implemented in [specific area of product]?  
    - How are we currently implementing [specific product capability]?  
    - What systems are involved in delivering [specific feature]?  
    - Show me all the different ways users can [accomplish specific goal]  
    - How configurable is [specific feature] for different use cases?  
    - What dependencies exist for [specific feature]?  
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### **Prompting Tips**

1. **Anchor concepts together** ‚Äì Start by identifying how parts of the codebase relate. For example: ‚ÄúHow does Feature X interact with Feature Y?‚Äù
2. **Adjust context scope** ‚Äì Think intentionally about whether your question should span multiple modules or zoom in on a specific file or function.
3. **Define the output you want** ‚Äì Be clear whether you're looking for code examples, summaries, API shapes, or configuration formats (e.g., ‚ÄúShow this as JSON‚Äù).
4. **Follow the thread** ‚Äì After a useful result, ask follow-ups like ‚ÄúWhy was this implemented this way?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWho changed it last?‚Äù
