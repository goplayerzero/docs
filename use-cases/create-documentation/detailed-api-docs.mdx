# Overview

Through PlayerZero's intelligent chat interface, teams can easily document their APIs by describing endpoints and implementations to the AI, which helps generate clear, structured documentation complete with examples and parameter descriptions. The AI assistant can help translate technical API specifications into clear, understandable documentation by providing contextual suggestions, formatting help, and ensuring consistency across all endpoint descriptions. This guide will show you how to quickly create and share documentation across your team.

## Prerequisites

## Process

### 1. Kickoff an AI Chat, Set Context
Begin by opening PlayerZero‚Äôs AI chat interface and clearly stating your goal. For example:

> "I want to document our user authentication API endpoints. Can you help me create clear documentation?"

This establishes the context and helps the AI tailor its assistance to your specific objectives.

üëâ [Start an AI Chat session](https://app.playerzero.ai/chat)

### 2. Describe Your API 
Next, provide the AI with a clear, concise description of the endpoint you want to document. You can keep it natural and informal‚Äîthe AI will handle the structure. For example:

> "The POST `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint accepts email and password in the request body, validates the credentials, and returns a JWT token along with user information."

From this, the AI will generate a baseline documentation layout with headers, parameter sections, and descriptions.

### 3. Refine with AI Assistance
Now that the structure is in place, the AI can help elevate the quality of the content. It might:
- Reformat and clean up inconsistencies
- Fill in parameter descriptions
- Flag missing details
- Suggest helpful additions like authentication requirements, rate limits, or status codes

This phase is collaborative‚Äîcontinue the conversation to improve clarity and coverage.

### 4. Add Code Examples
Practical usage examples bring your documentation to life. You can describe the kind of code snippets or command-line usage you want to include, and the AI will help convert those into properly formatted examples. These examples help readers quickly understand how to use the API in real-world scenarios.

### 5. Review and Enhance
With the core documentation in place, review it for completeness and usability. Ask the AI to identify gaps, suggest improvements, or reorganize sections for better flow. You might decide to include common error responses, note deprecated endpoints, or add edge case behavior. This is where your documentation transforms from functional to polished.

### 6. Share Documentation
Once you're happy with the result, use PlayerZero‚Äôs built-in sharing features to distribute your work. You can tag specific teammates, copy links, or enable comments. This makes it easy to gather feedback or provide documentation to a broader audience‚Äîincluding both technical teams and stakeholders.

    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - How do I structure documentation for [specific endpoint]?  
    - Which HTTP verbs and routes are most relevant for [service]?  
    - What status codes should be documented for [endpoint]?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Parameter Descriptions & Validation">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - What parameters are required by [endpoint]?  
    - How do I document optional vs. required fields?  
    - Which data types are expected for each parameter?  
    - How should I describe validation rules?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Request/Response Examples">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - How do I provide sample `curl` or code snippets for my docs?  
    - Can you show me a success and error JSON response for [endpoint]?  
    - Where should I include notes on authentication or rate limits?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collaboration & Sharing">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - How do I share these docs with both technical and non-technical teams?

  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

**Prompting Tips**

1. **Combine details** ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow do I describe both request parameters and response fields for `/api/v1/orders`?‚Äù  
2. **Ask for formatting** ‚Äì ‚ÄúFormat my docs as a Markdown table of parameters.‚Äù  
3. **Request clarifications** ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhich status codes and error messages should we include?‚Äù  
4. **Use follow-ups** ‚Äì ‚ÄúShow me how rate limits should be described for this endpoint.‚Äù
