# Overview

When a user reports an issue or experiences unexpected application behavior, you need a straightforward way to not only understand what was happening but track down where things went wrong—both in frontend interactions and backend traces. **PlayerZero** helps your team follow a user’s journey, pinpoint the cause of an error, and quickly jump into relevant parts of the code for a fix. This guide walks you through how to debug a user session, step-by-step.

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, confirm that:

1. **Your SCM system is integrated with PlayerZero**
    
    This allows PlayerZero to query your repository and link trace data to specific code lines.
    
2. **The PlayerZero Web SDK is instrumented**
    
    This captures user actions, DOM state, and network traffic for comprehensive frontend visibility.
    
    *Without these in place, your logs and user sessions won’t be linked correctly, or you won’t see the full picture of user actions in PlayerZero.*
    


**Backend / OpenTelemetry Data**

If you want a unified view of backend traces alongside your frontend data, you must be sending OpenTelemetry data to PlayerZero. It is not suggested to connect this data until the two previous datasources are connected and the core PlayerZero workflows are understood by your team. 

# Process

PlayerZero leverages your SCM and telemetry data to save your engineering and support time when a customer reaches out with an issue.

**Scenario**: A customer files a support ticket complaining about an error that occurs after they click “Submit” on your signup form. 

### 1. Field the user complaint and retrieve key details

To get started, you only need the following details: name/email, time/date, description of the issue.

*Note: You can integrate your ticketing system (e.g., Zendesk, Jira) with PlayerZero for a seamless reference, but it’s not strictly required to start debugging.*

### 2. Associate the complaint to a specific moment in the user’s session

Now that you’ve captured the 3 key details (name/email, time/date, description of the issue), you can begin to connect that customer’s communicated issue to a real session, and all related context, in PlayerZero. Here’s how:

1. **Search for the user on the [users page](https://go.playerzero.app/users)**
    - Filter by the user’s name, email or user ID on the users page for quicker search.
2. Navigate to the appropriate user session under “activity” at the bottom of the page
    - Locate the time window matching the user’s complaint and click into the associated session.
3. **Find the moment in time the customer ran into an issue**
    - Inside each PlayerZero user session, you’ll see a three-pane interface:
        1. **User Actions (Left) –** Logs each click, scroll, or form submission made by the user.
            - Each user debug session includes a clickable stream of events and actions listen on the left. This stream will go back to the beginning of time (or to the beginning of the data storage window.)
            - In the case of our example, you would search for the “Submit” action related to the reported issue.
        2. **DOM Recreation (Middle) –** Provides a visual replay of the user’s screen.
        3. **Developer Context (Right) –** View network requests, responses, and data payloads the user sent.
            - This is particularly important if the user’s error is triggered by an API call or a missing data field.


Tip: Watch the middle pane’s playback to see what the user did just before the error. Correlate that with the left and right panes to find the root cause (e.g., a failed API request, a null field, or a UI glitch).

### 3. Analyze Frontend and Backend Traces

Now that you’ve found the moment in time where the user experiences the issue, you can look more deeply into the technical performance of the application. 

1. **Analyze network traffic**
    - Look for request/response pairs that returned an error status (4xx or 5xx) around the same time as the user’s action.
    - Inspect response bodies for “Invalid Request,” “Unauthorized,” or other error text.
2. **Review Backend Traces (OpenTelemetry Data)**
    - If you have OTel data flowing in, PlayerZero correlates the user’s frontend session with the backend service calls.
    - Switch to the “Traces” or “Logs” view to see how the request traveled through your backend services.
3. **Pinpoint the Critical Span**
    - In a waterfall or timeline view, look for the span that shows an error or high latency.
    - This helps you zero in on the service or function call that likely caused the issue.

### Summary and Next Steps

By following these steps, you’ve connected a user’s ticket to their session, examined critical user actions, explored relevant backend traces, and jumped directly into the code that caused the error.

**Next steps might include:**

- Configure Slack or Microsoft Teams alerts to get real-time updates when critical user errors occur.
- Connect your customer/product support platforms (e.g., Azure DevOps, Zendesk) directly to PlayerZero for a streamlined feedback loop.
- Explore Alternative Debugging Flows
    - Start from an error log in PlayerZero and trace forward to impacted sessions.
    - Begin with a trace in the backend to see which user sessions are affected.
    - Leverage pull request reviews in PlayerZero to catch potential issues before they reach production.
