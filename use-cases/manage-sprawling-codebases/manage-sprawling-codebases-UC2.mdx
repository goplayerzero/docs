# Overview

PlayerZero acts as your pair-programming AI assistant, enabling you to query and understand unfamiliar code through natural language questions. The system instantly surfaces relevant files, dependencies, and code flows without having to grep through multiple repositories. By building a deep understanding of your code's architecture and recent changes, PlayerZero can explain complex implementations in clear technical terms with direct references to the source.  

When you need to debug issues or take ownership of another developer's code, you can quickly ramp up without piecing together scattered documentation or chasing down former team members for context. Simply ask the AI about any part of the implementation and get immediate, technically accurate explanations tailored to your project.

## **Prerequisites**

### Source Control Management (Codebase)

**Your codebase is connected to PlayerZero**  
This enables PlayerZero to associate runtime errors, traces, and sessions back to the exact lines of code in your repository.

*This is the foundational integration ‚Äî all other data sources rely on it to establish full context across your stack.*

‚Üí To set this up, navigate to the [SCM Setup Guide].

## **Process**

### 1. **Start a Code Understanding Session**  
Open PlayerZero‚Äôs AI chat interface and clearly state your goal. For example:

> "I need to figure out how the user authentication logic works in our Node.js service. Can you walk me through the relevant code files and dependencies?"

This initial query sets the context and helps the AI focus on the specific code area you need to understand.

### 2. **Ask About the Code**  
Describe what you‚Äôre looking for in plain English. You might ask:

> "Show me the function that processes webhook events and explain its key steps."

PlayerZero will locate relevant files, highlight important code sections, and provide an overview of how the code works.

### 3. **Refine with AI Assistance**  
Build on the AI‚Äôs response by asking follow-up questions. The AI can:

- Identify missing information
- Suggest potential interactions or dependencies
- Provide deeper explanations of the code‚Äôs business purpose

Keep this conversation going until you have a clear grasp of the technical flow.

### 4. **Dive into Dependencies**  
Ask the AI to surface how the code connects to other services, libraries, or APIs:

> "What other parts of the system call this webhook handler?"
> "How does the data flow once we receive the webhook event?"

PlayerZero will trace through your codebase to show integrations, data paths, and potential failure points.

### 5. **Review and Summarize**  
Have PlayerZero provide a concise summary of the code‚Äôs logic and purpose. This can include:

- How user interactions trigger certain flows
- The key data transformations or validations
- The overall business logic behind the feature

These summaries act as living documentation you can reference later or share with teammates.

### 6. **Share Knowledge**  
Once you‚Äôre confident in your understanding, use PlayerZero‚Äôs collaboration features to share these insights:

- Tag relevant teammates and invite them to review
- Copy direct links to AI explanations
- Enable feedback and comments

This centralizes context for everyone, from developers to product managers.

### 7. **Iterate and Expand**  
As you dive further or new code changes come in, continue to refine your understanding. Update or add to these AI-driven explanations so they remain accurate and relevant. This ongoing process keeps everyone on the same page and accelerates onboarding for new team members.

#### **Prompting Tips**

1. **Combine details** ‚Äì ‚ÄúFind the `email notification` code and explain how user preferences are applied.‚Äù  
2. **Ask for historical context** ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhen was this last changed, and who did it?‚Äù  
3. **Request clarifications** ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat are the main error handling strategies here?‚Äù  
4. **Use follow-ups** ‚Äì ‚ÄúShow me where else these patterns appear in the codebase.‚Äù
