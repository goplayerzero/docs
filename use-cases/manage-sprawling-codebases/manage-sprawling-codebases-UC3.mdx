# Overview

PlayerZero transforms your codebase interactions into shareable knowledge by letting you generate contextual explanations of code that combine AI analysis with your own expertise. Without needing to rely on the time of other people, you can gain or share knowledge by leveraging PlayerZero's AI chat experience. 

## Prerequisites

<SourceControlManagement/>

## Process

### 1. Kickoff an AI Chat, Set Context
Open PlayerZero‚Äôs AI chat interface and let it know you want to share some key insights about your code. For example:

> "I want to explain how our payment module handles retries after failed attempts. Can we create a knowledge session for that?"

This prompt sets the stage and helps the AI tailor responses to your specific topic.

üëâ [Start an AI Chat session](https://app.playerzero.ai/chat)

### 2. Provide Context About the Code  
Offer relevant details about files, major components, or architectural decisions. You don‚Äôt need to write a formal document‚Äîjust describe the essential points:

> "The `payment-retry.js` file includes logic for checking if a payment should be retried, referencing our rate-limit configuration in `config.js`."

From here, the AI will help create a structured explanation that includes references, critical gotchas, and related modules or dependencies.

### 3. Refine with AI Assistance 
Use the AI to clarify or deepen the explanation. You can:
- Ask for reorganizing details
- Include references to relevant version control history
- Highlight architectural implications
- Flag potential pitfalls for new developers

This ensures your knowledge session covers the information people really need.

### 4. Add Code Examples or References
Include relevant code snippets or commit references. The AI can transform informal descriptions into clean, readable examples. These examples help teammates quickly grasp how the code works:

> "Here‚Äôs a snippet showing how retries are handled for payment errors. Can we format it clearly for future reference?" or "Please provide a code snippet showing how retries are handled for payment errors"

### 5. **Review and Enhance**  
Check your session for accuracy and completeness. Request the AI‚Äôs help to:
- Point out missing pieces
- Suggest improved flow or structure
- Incorporate short historical notes (e.g., ‚ÄúWe added this after version 1.2 because‚Ä¶.‚Äù)

### 6. **Share Sessions**  
Once your explanation is polished, share it directly within PlayerZero. Teammates can comment or ask follow-ups, creating a living document that evolves with your code.
