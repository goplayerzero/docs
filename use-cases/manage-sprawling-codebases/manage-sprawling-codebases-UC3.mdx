# Overview

PlayerZero transforms your codebase interactions into shareable knowledge by letting you generate contextual explanations of code that combine AI analysis with your own expertise. When you understand something valuable about the code‚Äîbe it a complex implementation detail, an architectural decision, or a tricky edge case‚Äîyou can create focused chat sessions that walk other devs through the specifics.

These chat sessions remain dynamic and interactive. Other devs can ask follow-up questions, explore related code paths, and get updated context as the code evolves. This makes it perfect for quick knowledge transfers during pair programming, code reviews, or when handing off features to new team members.

## **Prerequisites**

### Source Control Management (Codebase)

**Your codebase is connected to PlayerZero**  
This enables PlayerZero to map relevant file references, recent changes, and architectural decisions back to your repository.  

*This foundational integration provides the full context needed to create effective AI-powered knowledge sessions.*

‚Üí To set this up, navigate to the [SCM Setup Guide].

## **Process**

### 1. **Start a Knowledge Sharing Session**  
Open PlayerZero‚Äôs AI chat interface and let it know you want to share some key insights about your code. For example:

> "I want to explain how our payment module handles retries after failed attempts. Can we create a knowledge session for that?"

This prompt sets the stage and helps the AI tailor responses to your specific topic.

### 2. **Provide Context About the Code**  
Offer relevant details about files, major components, or architectural decisions. You don‚Äôt need to write a formal document‚Äîjust describe the essential points:

> "The `payment-retry.js` file includes logic for checking if a payment should be retried, referencing our rate-limit configuration in `config.js`."

From here, the AI will help create a structured explanation that includes references, critical gotchas, and related modules or dependencies.

### 3. **Refine with AI Assistance**  
Use the AI to clarify or deepen the explanation. You can:
- Ask for reorganizing details
- Include references to relevant version control history
- Highlight architectural implications
- Flag potential pitfalls for new developers

This ensures your knowledge session covers the information people really need.

### 4. **Add Code Examples or References**  
Include relevant code snippets or commit references. The AI can transform informal descriptions into clean, readable examples. These examples help teammates quickly grasp how the code works:

> "Here‚Äôs a snippet showing how retries are handled for payment errors. Can we format it clearly for future reference?"

### 5. **Review and Enhance**  
Check your session for accuracy and completeness. Request the AI‚Äôs help to:
- Point out missing pieces
- Suggest improved flow or structure
- Incorporate short historical notes (e.g., ‚ÄúWe added this after version 1.2 because‚Ä¶.‚Äù)

### 6. **Share Sessions**  
Once your explanation is polished, share it directly within PlayerZero. Teammates can comment or ask follow-ups, creating a living document that evolves with your code.

### 7. **Iterate and Update**  
Code is never static. As your system changes, your knowledge sessions should adapt. Open the AI chat to update or expand sections. This continuous loop ensures your documentation remains fresh and valuable.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Key Use Cases">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - Can you outline main debugging steps for [critical system issue]?  
    - Which modules or services are most relevant for [feature area]?  
    - How do teams handle cross-team handoffs or code reviews in PlayerZero?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advantages">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - How do we preserve system knowledge for new hires?

  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

#### **Prompting Tips**

1. **Combine details** ‚Äì ‚ÄúExplain both our retry logic and the fallback process when the user is offline.‚Äù  
2. **Ask for formatting** ‚Äì ‚ÄúCan you present that explanation in bullet points with references to file paths?‚Äù  
3. **Request clarifications** ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat potential issues might arise from concurrency in our retry mechanism?‚Äù  
4. **Use follow-ups** ‚Äì ‚ÄúShow me how to add a note about external API rate limits in this explanation.‚Äù
