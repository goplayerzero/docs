# Overview

By building a deep understanding of your code's architecture and recent changes, PlayerZero can explain complex implementations in clear technical terms with direct references to the source. When you need to debug issues or take ownership of another developer's code, you can quickly ramp up without piecing together scattered documentation or chasing down former team members for context. Simply ask the AI about any part of the implementation and get immediate, technically accurate explanations tailored to your project.

## Prerequisites

## Process

### 1. Kickoff an AI Chat, Set Context
Open PlayerZero‚Äôs AI chat interface and clearly state your goal. For example:

> "I need to figure out how the user authentication logic works in our Node.js service. Can you walk me through the relevant code files and dependencies?"

This initial query sets the context and helps the AI focus on the specific code area you need to understand.

üëâ [Start an AI Chat session](https://go.playerzero.app)

### 2. Ask Code-Level Questions
Describe what you‚Äôre looking for in plain English. You might ask:

> "Show me the function that processes webhook events and explain its key steps."

PlayerZero will locate relevant files, highlight important code sections, and provide an overview of how the code works.

### 3. Refine with AI Assistance
Build on the AI‚Äôs response by asking follow-up questions. The AI can:

- Identify missing information
- Suggest potential interactions or dependencies
- Provide deeper explanations of the code‚Äôs business purpose

Keep this conversation going until you have a clear grasp of the technical flow.

### 4. Dive into Dependencies
Ask the AI to surface how the code connects to other services, libraries, or APIs:

> "What other parts of the system call this webhook handler?"
> "How does the data flow once we receive the webhook event?"

PlayerZero will trace through your codebase to show integrations, data paths, and potential failure points.

### 5. Review and Summarize
Have PlayerZero provide a concise summary of the code‚Äôs logic and purpose. This can include:

- How user interactions trigger certain flows
- The key data transformations or validations
- The overall business logic behind the feature

These summaries act as living documentation you can reference later or share with teammates.

### 6. Share Knowledge
Once you‚Äôre confident in your understanding, use PlayerZero‚Äôs collaboration features to share these insights:

- Tag relevant teammates and invite them to review
- Copy direct links to AI explanations
- Enable feedback and comments

This centralizes context for everyone, from developers to product managers.
