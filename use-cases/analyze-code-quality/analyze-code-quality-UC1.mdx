# Overview

PlayerZero guides developers toward effective code fixes by combining detailed session recordings, error contexts, and code understanding into a comprehensive analysis. The system examines similar code changes and historical fixes across the codebase to identify patterns and potential solutions, while also considering the specific user interactions that triggered the issue. This contextual approach not only helps developers understand what to fix but also why the fix is needed, ensuring that solutions address the root cause while maintaining alignment with the codebase's existing patterns and best practices.

## **Prerequisites**

### Source Control Management (Codebase)

**Your codebase is connected to PlayerZero**
This enables PlayerZero to map runtime errors, traces, and sessions back to the exact lines of code in your repository.

*This is the foundational integration â€” all other data sources (traces, tickets, sessions) rely on it to establish full context across your stack.*

â†’ To set this up, navigate to the [SCM Setup Guide]([https://go.playerzero.app](https://go.playerzero.app/)).

## **Process**

This guide walks you through how to locate and interpret functional tests automatically generated by PlayerZero when reviewing pull requests.

### **1. Search for your PR**

Navigate to the Pull Requests page and find your PR by using the search bar.

- Search by title, branch name, or keywords within the PR content.

*Note: Quick access to the relevant PR speeds up test review.*

### **2. Open the PR details view**

Click your PR to open the details view and access functional test data.

- Use the 'Summary' tab to see a centralized test list.
- Use the 'Files Changed' tab to view test groupings by file, along with their completion status and related code.

*Note: Both tabs help identify test coverage across code changes.*

### **3. Interact with the functional test checklist**

Review PlayerZero's auto-generated comment, which includes a test summary and links.

- The comment updates automatically when new commits are pushed.
- Click 'View more in PlayerZero' to explore the full test checklist and trace details.

*Note: Staying within the PR page streamlines your review workflow.*
