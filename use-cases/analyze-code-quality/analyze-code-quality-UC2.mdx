# Overview

PlayerZero identifies regressions by comparing your current code changes against historical bugs and customer frustrations. Through AI-driven embeddings, PlayerZero creates semantic fingerprints of both new code diffs and past tickets, then uses vector similarity matching to surface the most relevant historical issues. If overlaps are found, PlayerZero generates targeted regression tests directly in your PR, highlighting exactly which past problems could recur.

## **Prerequisites**

<SourceControlManagement/>

---

## **Process**

### 1. Navigate to the Pull Requests page

Use the search bar to locate your PR by title, branch name, or relevant keywords in the PR description.

*Note: Quickly narrowing down to the right PR is key to reviewing potential regressions.*

### 2. View the "Regression Tests" section

In your PR details:
1. Look for the "Regression Tests" section, typically under the automatically generated PlayerZero comment.  
2. Review each test’s summary, which highlights the original customer issue, when it occurred, and its relevance to your current changes.

*Note: PlayerZero pinpoints where and why a regression could arise, referencing real incidents that affected these specific code paths.* 

### 3. Dive deeper into historical context

Click on any listed regression test to explore:
- **Original ticket**: Understand the root cause, user frustration, or bug context.  
- **Impact**: Review how this bug previously affected customers or systems.  
- **Affected code**: See exactly which lines or modules were involved.

*Note: Immediate access to historical details ensures you can replicate, test, or guard against a re-emerging bug.*

### 4. Confirm or refute regressions in your PR

Leverage PlayerZero’s comment updates to mark regression tests as verified, in-progress, or no longer relevant:
- The comment dynamically refreshes with your PR’s progress and new commits.
- Confirming or resolving potential regressions helps the entire team stay informed.

*Note: Keeping regression status up-to-date prevents redundant re-checking of the same issues.*

### Scenarios for Investigating Regressions

Want to understand potential regressions faster? You can interact directly with PlayerZero’s AI Chat to explore the origin, frequency, and impact of historical issues tied to your code changes.

Use the categories below to guide your investigation with the right level of historical context. Each accordion outlines a regression-related scenario you can explore using PlayerZero’s contextual tools.

#### **Contextual Scenarios**

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion 
    title="Previously Reported Bugs – Ensuring repeat issues are squashed"
  >
    **Context Scenarios**:
    - You see a regression test flagged from a known bug and want to verify it.
    - You’re analyzing the root cause of a bug to confirm your new PR won’t trigger it again.
    - You need to learn if there’s an established fix or workaround for this bug in another part of the code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion 
    title="Customer Frustrations – Matching code changes to past user pain points"
  >
    **Context Scenarios**:
    - You’re reminded of a previous complaint and want to see if the same code area is affected.
    - You’re prioritizing user-impactful changes and need to confirm coverage for critical customer issues.
    - You want to confirm that new code logic addresses or improves the frustrating scenarios previously reported.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion 
    title="Tracing Overlapping Areas – Finding related files or modules"
  >
    **Context Scenarios**:
    - The regression test points to multiple files historically linked by a single bug.
    - You need to understand how different services or modules tie into a past incident.
    - You’re investigating whether your PR inadvertently touches code with a known vulnerability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion 
    title="Avoiding Future Risk – Preventing the same pitfalls"
  >
    **Context Scenarios**:
    - You’re adding new logic on top of a previously fragile flow.
    - You want to confirm that tests cover edge cases around code that failed before.
    - You’re ensuring the same root cause doesn’t remain hidden in other parts of the codebase.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

#### **Prompting Tips**

1. **Anchor concepts together** – “How does [Service A] interact with [Library B]?”
2. **Adjust context scope** – Zoom in on specific files or pull system-wide dependencies.
3. **Define the output you want** – Ask for code snippets, summaries, relationships, or histories.
4. **Follow the thread** – Use follow-ups like “Where else is this service used?”

## Summary and Next Steps

By following these steps, you ensure every significant past issue or customer complaint relevant to your code changes is flagged in your PR. PlayerZero’s automated regression checks reduce the risk of reintroducing historical bugs, guiding you to review and validate these areas proactively.

With your codebase connected, PlayerZero maps every pull request to a curated set of regression tests based on semantic overlaps. This goes beyond simple file matching—PlayerZero’s AI searches for underlying similarities in code, logic, and bug descriptions. As a result, your team can systematically prevent regressions and keep development flowing confidently.
