# Overview

PlayerZero automatically generates clear, contextual summaries of code changes at both the pull request level and for individual file changes, making code reviews more efficient and accessible to all team members. Each changed file includes a detailed explanation of what was modified and why, helping reviewers quickly understand the impact and purpose of specific code modifications. The system also provides a comprehensive pull request summary that explains the overall changes, their business purpose, and potential risks to different features of your application.

## **Process**

This process walks you through initiating an AI-driven investigation in PlayerZero, starting with a question and refining insights through targeted follow-ups grounded in real code and user context.

---

### 1. **Initiate the AI chat session with a question**

From the input field on the homepage, you can ask a question directly to PlayerZero.

*Note: You can integrate your ticketing system (e.g., Zendesk, Jira) with PlayerZero for a seamless reference, but it‚Äôs not strictly required to start debugging.*

### 2. **Guide the Investigation with follow-up questions**

PlayerZero provides targeted explanations and suggestions based on your focus areas, drawing from both codebase knowledge and user session data.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion 
    title="Discovering Best Practices ‚Äì Standards and approaches for typical scenarios"
  >
    **Context Scenarios**:
    - You're implementing a known flow (like authentication or pagination) and want to follow internal standards.
    - You're writing tests or error handling and want to align with existing practices in the codebase.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion 
    title="Maintaining Consistency ‚Äì Aligning new work with existing implementations"
  >
    **Context Scenarios**:
    - You're submitting a PR and want to ensure your code aligns with established patterns.

#### **Prompting Tips**

1. **Anchor concepts together** ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow does [Service A] interact with [Library B]?‚Äù
2. **Adjust context scope** ‚Äì Zoom in on specific files or pull system-wide dependencies.
3. **Define the output you want** ‚Äì Ask for code snippets, summaries, relationships, or histories.
4. **Follow the thread** ‚Äì Use follow-ups like ‚ÄúWhere else is this service used?‚Äù
