## Process

This process walks you through initiating an AI-driven investigation in PlayerZero, starting with a question and refining insights through targeted follow-ups grounded in real code and user context.

### 1. Understand Code Summaries in PlayerZero
1. Navigate to the Pull Requests page and find your PR using the search functionality.
2. The "Summary" tab provides a high-level overview of all changes, while the "Files Changed" tab shows detailed per-file summaries.
3. In the Files Changed view, each modified file includes a summary explaining what changed and why, helping reviewers understand the context and purpose of specific modifications.

<Tip> PlayerZero chunks code changes and uses AI embeddings to analyze both the modified code and its surrounding context, generating human-readable explanations that focus on functional changes rather than superficial modifications. These summaries are then enriched with repository-level context through a recursive summarization process that evaluates technical changes against defined product features to assess risk and impact. </Tip>

### 2. Receive Code Summaries Natively in Your PRs
- PlayerZero automatically adds both a high-level PR summary and detailed file-specific summaries as comments in your PR.
- The summaries update automatically when new changes are pushed, ensuring reviewers always have current context.
- Click through to PlayerZero for an interactive view that shows both the technical changes and their business impact.

### 3. Understanding Feature Risk Analysis

PlayerZero analyzes how your changes might impact different features of your product based on your defined Product Guidance. It is broken down into the following categories:

- **None**: No direct impact to this feature
- **Low**: Minor changes with minimal risk
- **Moderate**: Significant changes requiring careful testing
- **High**: Major changes with potential broad impact

For each impacted feature, PlayerZero provides:

- A summary of how the changes affect the feature
- Specific areas requiring attention
- Related test cases that should be prioritized
- Historical context of past issues in these areas
