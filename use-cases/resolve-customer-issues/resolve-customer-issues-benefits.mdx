PlayerZero captures detailed session context by recording every user interaction, DOM change, and network request in real-time. This gives engineering and support teams the full picture needed to diagnose issues faster, reproduce bugs with precision, and reduce resolution time.

## Benefits of Using PlayerZero for Session Context
- **End-to-End Visibility**: Capture frontend events, network activity, and backend traces in a unified view, making it easy to trace issues across the stack.
- **Accurate Reproductions**: Watch session replays with full DOM snapshots to see exactly what the user experienced at the time of the issue.
- **Streamlined Debugging**: Eliminate guesswork with technical traces and logs tied directly to user sessions, enabling faster root cause analysis.
- **Contextual Code Mapping**: Link errors and traces to specific lines of code, so engineers can immediately identify and fix the source of issues.
- **Cross-Team Alignment**: Give support, QA, and engineering a shared understanding of user-reported problems without redundant back-and-forth.
- **Accelerated Issue Resolution**: Resolve defects faster by combining user context with distributed telemetry in a centralized debugging workspace.
