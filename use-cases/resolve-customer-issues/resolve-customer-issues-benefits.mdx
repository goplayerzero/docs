## Benefits of Using PlayerZero for Session Context
- **End-to-End Visibility**: PlayerZero captures frontend events, network activity, and backend traces in a unified view, making it easy to trace issues across the stack.
- **Accurate Reproductions**: PlayerZero displays session replays with full DOM snapshots to see exactly what the user experienced at the time of the issue.
- **Eliminate Guesswork**: PlayerZero creates distributed traces and ties logs directly to user sessions, enabling faster root cause analysis.
- **Contextual Code Mapping**: PlayerZero link errors and traces to specific lines of code, so engineers can immediately identify and fix the source of issues.
- **Cross-Team Alignment**: PlayerZero gives support, QA, and engineering a shared understanding of user-reported problems without redundant back-and-forth.
- **Accelerated Issue Resolution**: PlayerZero helps resolve defects faster by combining user context with distributed telemetry in a centralized debugging workspace.
