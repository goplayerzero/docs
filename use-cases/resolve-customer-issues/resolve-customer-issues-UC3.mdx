# Overview
PlayerZero guides developers toward effective code fixes by combining detailed session recordings, error contexts, and code understanding into a comprehensive analysis. The system examines similar code changes and historical fixes across the codebase to identify patterns and potential solutions, while also considering the specific user interactions that triggered the issue. This contextual approach not only helps developers understand what to fix but also why the fix is needed, ensuring that solutions address the root cause while maintaining alignment with the codebase's existing patterns and best practices.

## **Prerequisites**

### Source Control Management (Codebase)

**Your codebase is connected to PlayerZero**

This enables PlayerZero to map runtime errors, traces, and sessions back to the exact lines of code in your repository.

*This is the foundational integration — all other data sources (traces, tickets, sessions) rely on it to establish full context across your stack.*

→ To set this up, navigate to the [SCM Setup Guide].

### Web SDK

**Your frontend is instrumented with PlayerZero**

This captures user actions, DOM snapshots, and network activity for full-session context. It bridges frontend events with backend telemetry when available.

*For complete session capture, ensure that backend telemetry is also connected.*

→ To set this up, navigate to the [Web SDK Setup Guide].

## **Process**

### Generate Code Fixes

Open up an existing AI chat, guide the investigation with follow-up questions, and then review and refine potential solutions.

### 1. **Open up an existing AI chat**

This workflow kicks off after you’ve created a chat with PlayerZero, where work has already been done to create a context window and internal workspace around the issue at hand. To learn how to do this, navigate to [connect errors to code].

### 2. **Guide the Investigation with follow-up questions**

Ask follow-up questions around key areas. Key areas might include specific error messages that catch your attention, code snippets you want to understand better, particular parts of the code (such as key services or files), or possible alternative routes or root causes to confirm.

*Note: PlayerZero provides targeted explanations and suggestions based on your focus areas, drawing from both codebase knowledge and user session data.*

### 3. **Review and Refine**

Assess, compare, and dive into different solutions and issue pathways.

*Note: PlayerZero keeps all context—code, debug data, and previous chat—readily available and interconnected, allowing you to build a complete understanding of the solution.*

## **Summary and Next Steps**

In this guide, we explored how to generate targeted code fixes by continuing an AI chat, asking focused follow-up questions, and evaluating refined solution paths using PlayerZero’s internal workspace. This workflow leverages past code changes, user-triggered context, and debugging history to suggest fixes aligned with established patterns and best practices. The result is a deeper understanding of both what needs to be fixed and why, reducing the likelihood of patching symptoms instead of root causes.
