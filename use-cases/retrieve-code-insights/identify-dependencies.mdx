## **Overview**

PlayerZero maps out your code’s interconnections—across services, files, and repositories—to give you a full picture of how your system fits together. By analyzing method calls, class references, and shared libraries, PlayerZero makes it easy to trace the ripple effects of a change, understand service interactions, and explore feature implementations across a distributed codebase.

## **Prerequisites**

### Source Control Management (Codebase)

**Your codebase is connected to PlayerZero**  
This enables PlayerZero to map runtime errors, traces, and sessions back to the exact lines of code in your repository.

*If you haven’t done this yet, see the [SCM Setup Guide].*

---

## **Process**

### 1. **Initiate the AI chat session with an initial question**  
From the input field on the homepage or via a debug report in DevTools, you can begin a conversation with PlayerZero.

- *Example*: “Which services rely on the user profile component?”

### 2. **Guide the Investigation with follow-up questions**  
PlayerZero provides targeted explanations and suggestions based on your focus, pulling from both code relationships and session data.

- *Example*: “What would break if I modify the user profile component?”

### **Code Exploration Insights – Understand your codebase faster**

Want to explore how systems are connected? PlayerZero’s AI Chat helps trace method calls, class usage, shared libraries, and data flow across your repositories.

Use the categories below to guide your investigation. Each accordion outlines a specific context in which dependency questions are most useful.

#### **Contextual Scenarios**

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Service-to-Service Interactions">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - What services are involved in the [specific feature] flow?  
    - Show the communication between [service A] and [service B]  
    - What APIs does [service] expose and who consumes them?  
    - Which services process messages or events from [another service]?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Repo Dependencies">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - Where is [shared component/class] used across repositories?  
    - Which repositories depend on [utility or library]?  
    - Show all references to [specific function] across services  
    - Where is [interface or abstract class] implemented?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk & Impact Analysis">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - What would break if I changed [shared function or component]?  
    - What downstream services are impacted by [specific change]?  
    - Who depends on [constant, config, or shared state]?  
    - Which systems are tightly coupled with [legacy implementation]?  
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### **Prompting Tips**

1. **Anchor concepts together** – For example: “How does [Service A] interact with [Library B]?”
2. **Adjust context scope** – Zoom in on specific files or expand to trace system-wide dependencies.
3. **Define the output you want** – Ask for call graphs, summaries, dependency trees, or history (e.g., “Show services that depend on this interface”).
4. **Follow the thread** – Use follow-ups like “What else uses this?” or “Who added this shared component?”

## **Summary and Next Steps**

With PlayerZero, tracing dependencies becomes fast, clear, and interactive. Whether you're navigating complex microservices or exploring code ownership, the AI chat gives you answers that span files, services, and repositories.

### Further Exploration
- **Map Cross-Service Dependencies** – Visualize system interactions to plan changes.  
- **Audit Shared Library Usage** – Understand where common libraries are implemented.  
- **Track Impact of Changes** – Identify what’s downstream before merging a PR.  
- **Expose Feature Scope** – Reveal which systems are involved in key features.
