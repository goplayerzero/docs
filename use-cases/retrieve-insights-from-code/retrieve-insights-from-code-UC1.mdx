# Overview

PlayerZero's code reasoning capability allows both technical and non-technical team members to interact with their codebase through natural language questions, receiving contextually aware responses that draw from actual source code, recent changes, and documentation. In this guide, we will dive deep into how you can retrieve key insights from details such as key services, files, and functions‚Äîwhile support and product teams without having to parse complex code.
## **Prerequisites**

<SourceControlManagement/>

## **Process**

### 1. **Initiate the AI chat session with an initial question**  
From the input field on the homepage, you can ask a question directly to PlayerZero.

- *Example*: ‚ÄúWhere is the main implementation of the user authentication service?‚Äù

### 2. **Guide the Investigation with follow-up questions**  
PlayerZero provides targeted explanations and suggestions based on your focus areas, drawing from both codebase knowledge and user session data.

- *Example*: ‚ÄúWho recently modified the user authentication flow and why?‚Äù

    - What changed in the [specific file/service] in recent PRs?  
    - How does our authentication flow work across services?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Questions for Support">
    - What happens when a user clicks [specific button/action]?  
    - Where are errors logged for [specific feature]?  
    - What are the possible error states for [specific flow]?  
    - How does the system validate [specific type of input]?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Questions for Product">
    - What features are implemented in [specific area of product]?
