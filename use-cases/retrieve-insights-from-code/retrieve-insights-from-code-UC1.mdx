# Overview

PlayerZero's code reasoning capability allows both technical and non-technical team members to interact with their codebase through natural language questions, receiving contextually aware responses that draw from actual source code, recent changes, and documentation. Engineers can dive deep into implementation details—such as key services, files, and functions—while support and product teams can understand feature behavior without having to parse complex code. This makes PlayerZero an invaluable tool for cross-functional collaboration.

By analyzing not just the code itself, but also recent code changes, pull requests, and user interactions, PlayerZero ensures responses are both current and relevant to your business context.

## **Prerequisites**

## **Process**

### 1. **Initiate the AI chat session with an initial question**  
From the input field on the homepage, you can ask a question directly to PlayerZero.

- *Example*: “Where is the main implementation of the user authentication service?”

### 2. **Guide the Investigation with follow-up questions**  
PlayerZero provides targeted explanations and suggestions based on your focus areas, drawing from both codebase knowledge and user session data.

- *Example*: “Who recently modified the user authentication flow and why?”

### **Role-Focused Prompting – Explore Your Codebase Faster**

Depending on your role, the AI chat can provide different types of insights. Use these categories to guide your questions and investigations.

#### **Contextual Scenarios**

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Questions for Developers">
    - Where is the main implementation of [specific function/service]?  
    - Show me all the places where [method/class] is being used  
    - What changed in the [specific file/service] in recent PRs?  
    - How does our authentication flow work across services?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Questions for Support">
    - What happens when a user clicks [specific button/action]?  
    - Where are errors logged for [specific feature]?  
    - What are the possible error states for [specific flow]?  
    - How does the system validate [specific type of input]?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Questions for Product">
    - What features are implemented in [specific area of product]?  
    - How are we currently implementing [specific product capability]?  
    - What systems are involved in delivering [specific feature]?  
    - Show me all the different ways users can [accomplish specific goal]  
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

#### **Prompting Tips**

1. **Anchor concepts together** – “How does [Service A] interact with [Library B]?”
2. **Adjust context scope** – Zoom in on specific files or pull system-wide dependencies.
3. **Define the output you want** – Ask for code snippets, summaries, relationships, or histories.
4. **Follow the thread** – Use follow-ups like “Where else is this service used?”
