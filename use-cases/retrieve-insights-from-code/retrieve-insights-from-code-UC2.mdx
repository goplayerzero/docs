# Overview

PlayerZero maps out your code‚Äôs interconnections‚Äîacross services, files, and repositories‚Äîto give you a full picture of how your system fits together. By analyzing method calls, class references, and shared libraries, PlayerZero makes it easy to trace the ripple effects of a change, understand service interactions, and explore feature implementations across a distributed codebase.

## **Prerequisites**

### Source Control Management (Codebase)

**Your codebase is connected to PlayerZero**
This enables PlayerZero to map runtime errors, traces, and sessions back to the exact lines of code in your repository. 

*This is the foundational integration ‚Äî all other data sources (traces, tickets, sessions) rely on it to establish full context across your stack.*

‚Üí To set this up, navigate to the [SCM Setup Guide](https://go.playerzero.app).

## **Process**

### 1. **Initiate the AI chat session with an initial question**  
From the input field on the homepage or via a debug report in DevTools, you can begin a conversation with PlayerZero.

- *Example*: ‚ÄúWhich services rely on the user profile component?‚Äù

### 2. **Guide the Investigation with follow-up questions**  
PlayerZero provides targeted explanations and suggestions based on your focus, pulling from both code relationships and session data.

- *Example*: ‚ÄúWhat would break if I modify the user profile component?‚Äù

Use the categories below to guide your investigation. Each accordion outlines a specific context in which dependency questions are most useful.

#### **Contextual Scenarios**

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Service-to-Service Interactions">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - What services are involved in the [specific feature] flow?  
    - Show the communication between [service A] and [service B]  
    - What APIs does [service] expose and who consumes them?  
    - Which services process messages or events from [another service]?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cross-Repo Dependencies">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - Where is [shared component/class] used across repositories?  
    - Which repositories depend on [utility or library]?  
    - Show all references to [specific function] across services  
    - Where is [interface or abstract class] implemented?  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Risk & Impact Analysis">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - What would break if I changed [shared function or component]?  
    - What downstream services are impacted by [specific change]?  
    - Who depends on [constant, config, or shared state]?  
    - Which systems are tightly coupled with [legacy implementation]?  
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

#### **Prompting Tips**

1. **Anchor concepts together** ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow does [Service A] interact with [Library B]?‚Äù
2. **Adjust context scope** ‚Äì Zoom in on specific files or pull system-wide dependencies.
3. **Define the output you want** ‚Äì Ask for code snippets, summaries, relationships, or histories.
4. **Follow the thread** ‚Äì Use follow-ups like ‚ÄúWhere else is this service used?‚Äù
