# Overview

PlayerZero can analyze historical code changes and implementations across your repositories, enabling developers to learn from past solutions and understand established patterns when implementing new features or solving similar problems. The following guide will demonstrate how PlayerZero can provide contextual insights into how similar features were built and what strategies are used across the codebase‚Äîcomplete with code examples and architectural decisions. 

## **Prerequisites**

<SourceControlManagement/>

## **Process**

### 1. **Initiate the AI chat session with a question**  
From the input field on the homepage, you can ask a question directly to PlayerZero.

- *Example*: ‚ÄúShow me examples of how we implement [design pattern] in our codebase?‚Äù

### 2. **Guide the Investigation with follow-up questions**  
PlayerZero provides targeted explanations and suggestions based on your focus areas, drawing from both codebase knowledge and user session data. Ask follow-up questions by leveraging the chat box, and highlight any part of the page to provide additional context for the AI.

- *Example*: ‚ÄúWhat patterns do we use for [specific functionality] across services?‚Äù

Use the categories below to guide your investigation. Each accordion outlines a specific angle to explore patterns, decisions, and best practices.

**Strategic Questioning Topics**

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Understanding Existing Patterns">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - "Show me examples of how we implement [design pattern] in our codebase"  
    - "How do we typically structure [specific type of component]?"  
    - "What patterns do we use for [specific functionality] across services?"  
    - "Show me recent implementations of [specific feature type]"  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Learning From Historical Decisions">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - "Why was [specific approach] chosen for [feature]?"  
    - "Show me how [specific functionality] has evolved over time"  
    - "What architectural decisions were made when implementing [feature]?"  
    - "Find discussions and comments about [architectural decision] in past PRs"  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Discovering Best Practices">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - "What's our standard approach for handling [specific scenario]?"  
    - "Show me the most recent implementations of [common functionality]"  
    - "How do we typically structure error handling in [specific service type]?"  
    - "What testing patterns do we use for [specific component type]?"  
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maintaining Consistency">
    **Context & Typical Questions**  
    - "Find similar implementations to [code snippet]"  
    - "How do other teams implement [specific functionality]?"  
    - "What's the preferred way to [accomplish specific task]?"  
    - "Show me examples of how we integrate with [specific system/service]"  
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## **Pro Tips for Effective Learning**

1. **Start broad** ‚Äì Begin with high-level architectural questions before diving into specific implementations.  
2. **Reference code snippets** ‚Äì Provide examples to anchor your questions about patterns or best practices.  
3. **Request variations** ‚Äì Ask for multiple examples to see different approaches used in your codebase.  
4. **Investigate context** ‚Äì Follow up on interesting implementations with questions about their history or rationale.  
5. **Ask for reasoning** ‚Äì Inquire about the decisions and trade-offs made in specific approaches.
