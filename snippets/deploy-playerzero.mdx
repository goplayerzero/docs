## **Create or Join a Project**

### **If you're creating a project for the first time**

1. [Create an account](https://go.playerzero.app)
2. Name and create a workspace
<Note> If you want other teammembers with the same email domain to be able to automatically join, check the "Allow anyone with @domain emails to join this project." box.</Note>

### **If you're joining an existing project**

1. [Create an account](https://go.playerzero.app)
2. If sharing has been setup correctly for the desired project, the name of the project will appear.
<Note>If you do not see the "Join an existing project" option, but rather just the "Create a new project" option, then contact your project admin and ask them to either invite you directly or enable domain sharing.</Note>


### **If you want to create/join an additional project**

At the top-left of the PlayerZero portal, select the option to create/join a new project. If you don't see the project you're looking for listed, contact your project admin and ask them to either invite you directly or enable domain sharing.



## Connect Your Code

The primary step is to grant PlayerZero access to your source control management (SCM) system. You may have already connected an SCM system during the signup process. If so, you can proceed to enabling specific repositories below.

<Note>To connect SCM systems, admin permissions are required on the repository you want to integrate.</Note>

To connect a repository:

1. Find the appropriate SCM connector on the homepage, or navigate to the [SCM connector list page](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/repos) in settings  
2. Select your SCM system  
3. Authorize PlayerZero with the required admin permissions on the repositories you wish to enable

## Enable Specific Repositories

After connecting your SCM, you need to select which repositories PlayerZero should monitor. In the settings page, toggle the repositories you want to enable for ingestion.

- On the [SCM connector list page](https://go.playerzero.app/setting/repos), toggle on repositories that should be ingested  
- Here you can also toggle the primary reference branch (Main/Master)

## Allow for Ingestion

Once you’ve enabled your repositories, PlayerZero will begin analyzing the code to surface relevant insights. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size and complexity of your repositories.

## Next Steps
