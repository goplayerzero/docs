## **Create or Join a Project**

### **If you're creating a project for the first time**

1. [Create an account](https://playerzero.ai)
2. Name and create a workspace
<Note> If you want other teammembers with the same email domain to be able to automatically join, check the "Allow anyone with @domain emails to join this project." box.</Note>

### **If you're joining an existing project**

1. [Create an account](https://playerzero.ai)
2. If sharing has been setup correctly for the desired project, the name of the project will appear.
<Note>If you do not see the "Join an existing project" option, but rather just the "Create a new project" option, then contact your project admin and ask them to either invite you directly or enable domain sharing.</Note>


### **If you want to create/join an additional project**

At the top-left of the PlayerZero portal, select the option to create/join a new project. If you don't see the project you're looking for listed, contact your project admin and ask them to either invite you directly or enable domain sharing.


## Connect & Enable Repositories

To connect PlayerZero to your version control and select which repositories to monitor, follow the guide for your SCM:

- **GitHub** – [GitHub Integration Guide](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/importing-code/github)
- **GitLab** – [GitLab Integration Guide](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/importing-code/gitlab)
- **Bitbucket** – [Bitbucket Integration Guide](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/importing-code/bitbucket)
- **Azure DevOps** – [Azure DevOps Integration Guide](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/importing-code/azure)

Each guide walks you through:

1. Authorizing PlayerZero with the required permissions  
2. Picking the repositories (and primary branch) you’d like PlayerZero to analyze  

<Note>Admin permissions are required on the repositories you connect.</Note>

## Allow for Ingestion

Once you’ve enabled your repositories, PlayerZero will begin analyzing the code to surface relevant insights. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size and complexity of your repositories.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! Now that you’re up and running, here are the next steps to get the most out of PlayerZero:

- [**Invite Your Team**](https://playerzero.ai/pz/settings/projects/playerzero/members) – Add team members to collaborate on issue tracking and resolution.
- [**Integrate with Ticketing Services**](https://playerzero.ai/pz/settings/projects/playerzero/integrations) – Connect PlayerZero to Jira, Azure DevOps, or other tools to sync issues with your workflow.
- [**Instrument the WebSDK**](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/capturing-user-sessions/web-sdk-instrumentation) – Enable user session tracking by integrating PlayerZero’s frontend WebSDK.
- [**Set Up OpenTelemetry**](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/integrating-with-opentelemetry/the-opentelemetry-standard) – Implement distributed tracing by connecting PlayerZero with OpenTelemetry.
