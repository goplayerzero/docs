### Source Control Management (Codebase)

Connect your codebase to PlayerZero enables PlayerZero to map runtime errors, traces, and sessions back to the exact lines of code in your repository.  

<Warning>This is the foundational integration — all other data sources (traces, tickets, sessions) rely on it to establish full context across your stack.</Warning>
