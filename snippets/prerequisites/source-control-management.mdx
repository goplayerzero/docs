### Source Control Management (Codebase)

**Your codebase is connected to PlayerZero**  
This enables PlayerZero to map runtime errors, traces, and sessions back to the exact lines of code in your repository.  

*This is the foundational integration — all other data sources (traces, tickets, sessions) rely on it to establish full context across your stack.*

→ To set this up, navigate to the [SCM Setup Guide](/developer-guide/configuration-guides/importing-code/import-git-setup-guide).
