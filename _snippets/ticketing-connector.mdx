## Support Ticketing Connectors
Ticketing connectors give PlayerZero visibility into:
- Customer complaints
- Product issue scope and impact
- Common patterns in customer feedback
- Feature requests

By connecting this ticketing source,
PlayerZero builds a map of everything your users are telling you about your product and its relationship with the work your team is doing.
This enables PlayerZero to measure the customer impact of your code.
