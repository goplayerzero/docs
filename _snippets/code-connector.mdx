## Code Connectors
Code integrations enable PlayerZero to become a part of your development and release process. They are critical to helping us:
* The nature of your code and product
* Understand what code is being changed and by whom
* Listen for the creation of pull or merge requests to start analyzing risk
* Understand when a new release is created
