## Engineering Connectors
Engineering connectors give PlayerZero visibility into:
-  Session logs
-  Backend errors and traces
-  Serverside events

With engineering connectors, PlayerZero logs all relevant technical insights for each user session. It then subsequently correlates these insights with relevant ticketing, SCM and analytics data to help teams gather full usage context and better answer why certain things are happening to their users.
