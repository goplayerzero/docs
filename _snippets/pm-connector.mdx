## Project Management Connectors
Project management connectors give PlayerZero visibility into:
- Issues and bugs logged
- Stories being worked on
- Releases made
- Internal feedback and issues logged
- Past issues that have been logged or backlogged

By hooking in a Project Management connector,
PlayerZero correlates internal tickets, tasks and progress to the work your engineering team is doing, in real time. This allows you to identify the highest risk code change based on work-items of the past, so you can be sure that you never make the same mistake twice.
