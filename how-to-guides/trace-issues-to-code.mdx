title: "Trace Issues to Code"
description: "Use PlayerZero to connect real-world errors and events directly to the responsible code, teams, and contributors."

Teams often lose time trying to identify where a customer issue originates. PlayerZero lets you **trace any issue to its source** — pinpointing the function, module, and even the engineer responsible.

---

## Example Prompts to Try

- “Show me which functions and modules caused the `checkout failed` errors last night.”  
- “A customer ran into `insert error/issue`, can you find the service and code line that triggered the timeout.”  
- “Identify any tickets potentially related to the the 500 errors we saw this week.”  
- “Highlight the most recent code changes tied to the login regression.”  

## Additional Tips

PlayerZero accelerates debugging by connecting **customer-facing problems** to **real code**:  

- **Offer detailed error or issue descriptions to give the AI more context clarity.
- **Include timestamps or session links** for faster correlation.  
- **Ask for ownership details** so triage and handoff are seamless.  
- **Chain follow-ups** like “what recent PRs touched this module?” to identify root causes quickly.
