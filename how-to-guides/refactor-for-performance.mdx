Refactoring is essential for maintainable, performant systems. PlayerZero helps **detect outdated or inefficient code patterns** and **suggest safer, modern alternatives**.

---

## Example Prompts to Try

- “Identify inefficient loops in our `Data Processing` module and suggest optimizations.”  
- “Show outdated API usage that should be replaced before scaling further.”  
- “Suggest modern alternatives for deprecated libraries in our codebase.”  

## Additional Tips

PlayerZero enables **safer refactoring** by:  
- **Highlighting risky or inefficient patterns**.  
- **Offering alternative implementations** aligned to your stack.  
- **Ensuring backward compatibility** to avoid regressions.
