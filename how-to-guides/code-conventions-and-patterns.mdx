title: "Surface Code Conventions and Patterns"
description: "Use PlayerZero to uncover and document the standards your team follows — from error handling to logging and validation — so everyone can build consistently."

Teams often struggle to keep code consistent, especially as projects grow or new engineers join. PlayerZero helps by **automatically surfacing the conventions, standards, and patterns** already in your codebase, so your team can align without manually digging through commits or outdated wikis.

---

## Example Prompts to Try

You can use prompts like these to quickly reveal the standards your team follows and share them across the organization:

- “Show how validation errors are handled across all services.”  
- “Document the standard logging approach for API requests.”  
- “Find examples of how authentication and authorization are implemented in our backend services.”  
- “Summarize common error-handling patterns and where they’re applied.”  
- “Generate a guide for new engineers showing our preferred approach to data modeling and validation.”

## Additional Tips

PlayerZero helps your team **codify best practices** directly from the codebase, so new and existing engineers can work consistently. When using it to surface conventions:

- **Start with areas that cause the most friction** — error handling, validation, logging, and data modeling.  
- **Ask for concrete examples** from your actual code so patterns are actionable.  
- **Iterate with follow-ups** — drill into specific services, modules, or teams to see how approaches vary.  
- **Turn the results into team guides** — share them with engineers and QA to keep standards aligned.

## Adapting PlayerZero to Your Environment

PlayerZero can help you **standardize your codebase** without slowing teams down:

- Document **your actual patterns**, not just what’s in a style guide.  
- Compare conventions across **different services or teams** to identify inconsistencies.  
- Export guides so new hires and cross-functional teams can ramp up quickly.
