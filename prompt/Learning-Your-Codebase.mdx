### Content

**User** I need help understanding my codebase. I have a complex application and want to create documentation that will help new developers get up to speed quickly. Please analyze my code files and create:

1. A high-level architecture overview
2. Documentation for key components and their relationships
3. An interactive diagram showing how data flows through the system
4. A summary of design patterns used
5. Explanations of any complex algorithms or logic

Make the output visually appealing and interactive so developers can explore different parts of the system by clicking on components.
